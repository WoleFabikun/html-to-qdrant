{"id": "afcfb87251a3-2", "text": "Home How CT Paid Leave Works CT Paid Leave and FMLA What is the Difference Between CT Paid Leave and FMLA? CT Paid Leave (CTPL) CT Paid Leave is a law that provides covered workers with income replacement benefits when they are out of work for certain qualifying family or health reasons, provided they meet specific eligibility requirements. CT Paid Leave does NOT provide job protected leave , which is the right to return to your same job, or an equivalent one, when your leave ends. Family and Medical Leave Acts (FMLA) The Family and Medical Leave Acts are laws that ensure that an employer returns an eligible worker who takes time away from their job for a qualifying reason to their same job, or an equivalent one, when they return from their leave. There is a federal FMLA and Connecticut FMLA . A worker must apply directly to their employer for job protected leave under one or both laws. EMPLOYEE RIGHTS UNDER CT FMLA AND CT PAID LEAVE VIEW QUALIFYING REASONS FOR CT FMLA AND CT PAID LEAVE Core Differences Between Laws While a worker will apply directly to the CT Paid Leave Authority for income replacement benefits during their leave, they need to apply to their employer if they wish to have job protected leave under FMLA. Without FMLA, there is no guarantee that the worker will be able to return to their job when their leave ends. CT Paid Leave CT FMLA Federal FMLA Protects Your Job Provides Income Replacement Applying for CT Paid Leave is not the same thing as applying for FMLA. Is My Employer Covered Under FMLA?

{"id": "afcfb87251a3-4", "text": "An employee who is seeking job-protected leave under the CT FMLA and/or federal FMLA  must apply to their  employer and provide all required documentation, including  medical certification, if applicable.  An individual who is seeking income replacement benefits under the CT Paid Leave Program must apply to the CT Paid Leave Authority and provide all required documentation, including medical certification, if applicable. The CT Paid Leave Authority will not share the medical records it receives with the employer. Can an employee be required to use their accrued paid time off (PTO) concurrently with CT Paid Leave? An employer may require their employees (or may allow their employees to choose) to use their accrued paid time off concurrently with CT Paid Leave, provided that the total compensation received by the employee does not exceed the employee's regular rate of compensation. The CT FMLA statute also states that an employer may require an employee to use accrued PTO while they are out of work on CT FMLA leave (whether or not the employee seeks benefits from the CT Paid Leave Authority) provided that the employer must allow the employee to retain at least two work weeks of accrued PTO or equivalent paid time off. What if a person is covered under CT Paid Leave, but not under FMLA? Unlike FMLA, CT Paid Leave does not offer job protection. CT Paid Leave is an income replacement benefit only. If a worker is not eligible for job-protected leave under CT FMLA or federal FMLA, the employer must analyze whether the worker is entitled to job-protected leave under any other statutes (like the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act or the CT Fair Employment Practices Act) or other company policies.  Even if the worker is not entitled to job-protected leave, and, as a result, loses their job, they may be eligible for income-replacement benefits under CT Paid Leave. Need More Help?

The benefit rate is capped at 60 times the Connecticut minimum wage. When are benefits paid?

Yes, to the extent that STD and LTD benefits are considered by the IRS to be taxable wages subject to FICA. The IRS defines sick pay as any amount paid under a plan for employees because of an employee\u2019s temporary absence from work due to injury, sickness or disability, whether paid directly by the employer or through an insurance company.\u00a0 Under this definition, short-term (STD) and long-term disability (LTD) benefits are considered by the IRS to be sick pay. STD and LTD benefits are considered taxable wages subject to FICA if the employer pays part or all of the premium for the coverage. See 2021 Publication 15-A (irs.gov) for more details about when and to what extent such benefits are considered taxable wages subject to FICA.\u00a0 (For example, FICA taxes apply to the full amount of the disability payment while the employee continues to perform services for the employer and for the first six calendar months after the employee has ceased performing services for the employer. Disability payments will be exempt from FICA starting in the seventh calendar month after the employee has stopped performing services for the employer.)\u00a0 Please consult your tax or legal advisor for more information about when such benefits are considered taxable wages subject to FICA. To the extent that the benefits are considered taxable wages subject to FICA, the 0.5% CT Paid Leave contribution must be deducted from such benefits. It is the employer\u2019s responsibility to remit the contributions. IRS regulations require insurers to process employees\u2019 FICA contributions from STD and LTD benefits in specific circumstances; however, there is no federal or state law that requires insurers to remit the CT Paid Leave Act contributions. \u00a0This is similar to the way the IRS assigns to the employer \u2013 not the insurer \u2013 the obligation to remit federal and state unemployment compensation taxes and state income taxes.", "keywords": ["insurance company", "ct paid", "std", "disability payment", "long-term disability", "act contributions", "ltd", "full amount", "insurer \u2013", "calendar months", "such benefits", "benefit payments", "publication", "employee \u2019 s", "process employees \u2019", "does", "employer \u2019 s responsibility", "state law", "state income taxes", "temporary absence", "employer \u2013", "state unemployment compensation taxes", "taxable wages subject", "calendar month", "disability", "irs", "fica", "std/ltd", "please", "specific circumstances", "legal advisor"], "topic": "frequently asked questions"}

It is also our experience that sole proprietors often need to spend some amount of time, even when on leave, dealing with bills and other correspondence. The way to deal with both situations with the least amount of delays and confusion is to estimate how much time you anticipate spending on these activities (for example, approximately 15%) and to apply for a reduced scheduled leave for the remainder (in this example 85%). When you go on leave, your benefit payment would be 85% of what it would otherwise be; however, the duration of your benefit will be extended proportionally.

With this method, each time an employee uses the CTPL benefit, the remaining benefit entitlement would be the balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the immediately preceding 12 months. For example: Lee requests two weeks of CTPL benefits to begin on February 1, 2023. The Authority looks back 12 months (from Feb.1, 2023 back to Feb. 2, 2022) and sees that Lee had received one week of CTPL benefits beginning March 1, 2022, seven weeks beginning May 15, 2022, and three weeks beginning November 1, 2022. Thus, Lee has received 11 weeks of CTPL benefits in the 12-month period and only has one week of CTPL benefits available.

{"id": "3f8d5a0f0cbf-8", "text": "How does the CTPL benefit interact with Short Term Disability benefits? The CT Paid Leave Act states that an employee can receive benefits from the CT Paid Leave program at the same times that they receive employer-provided income replacement benefits, as long as the total amount cannot be more than the employee's regular wages. There is no statutory requirement that the employer provide any income replacement benefit or, if it does, that the total amount will equal the employee's regular wages. If the employer provides short-term disability (STD) benefits to its employees, how much the employee will receive in STD benefits and whether the STD benefits will be reduced by the amount of CTPL benefits the employee actually receives or could have received is determined by the specific terms of the STD policy. FORMULA FOR PAID LEAVE BENEFITS -  How are CT PL benefits calculated? If employee\u2019s base weekly earnings are less than or equal to the minimum wage multiplied by 40, the CTPL benefit will be 95% of the covered employee\u2019s base weekly earnings, less any offsets. If the employee's weekly earnings are more than the CT minimum wage multiplied by 40, the CTPL benefit rate will be 95% of the CT minimum wage multiplied by 40 PLUS 60% of the amount the base weekly earnings exceed the CT minimum wage multiplied by 40, less any offsets. In all situations, however, the CTPL benefit is capped at sixty times (60x) the CT minimum wage. Does the increase in minimum wage change the benefit amount for existing claims? Any change in minimum wage that occurs during the course of an active claim will not affect the benefit amount because the benefit amount is based on your earnings in the base period (i.e., the first 4 quarters of five most recently completed quarters).

When calculating the contributions, employers should round to the nearest whole penny (i.e. to the second decimal point). What ID number should be used for reporting?  Format of ID? New ID or same ID as for SIT or SUI? The federal identification number (FEIN) is the primary ID number employers should use for reporting. What happens when an employer takes a deduction from an employee that is higher than 0.5%? Under the CT Paid Leave Act, employers are prohibited from taking a deduction that is greater than 0.5%. However, in limited circumstances, an employer may ask the CT Dept. of Labor for a waiver of this rule. If you see a CT Paid Leave related deduction that is higher than 0.5%, we encourage you to speak with your employer to determine if this is a mistake or if the employer received DOL approval.

How should this be explained to employees? Contributions to the CT Paid Leave fund are made by each employee in the amount of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of his or her salary (taken as a deduction from each paycheck), up to the Social Security contribution limit. The employee contributions are deposited in the CT Paid Leave Trust Fund, which funds all of the paid leave benefits.

The Connecticut Paid Leave program is designed to offer some income to those who participate in the program.

Determining Eligibility: The CT Paid Family Leave Act sets the rules for how the CT Paid Leave Authority determines if an employee is eligible for CT Paid Leave benefits and, if so, how to calculate those benefits. To determine eligibility, we have to look at the first four of the five most recently completed quarters at the time of the application and see if the applicant earned at least $2325 in the highest earning quarter of the four. Because the CT Paid Leave Authority can only consider wages earned in CT \u2013 or for a sole proprietor \u2013 earned while residing in CT, if you applied for benefits any time between January 1 and March 31, 2022, we would only be able to consider the income you earned in the 3 rd quarter of 2022 (July 1 through September 30, 2022). Because the statute requires the Authority to consider earnings per quarter, the CT Paid Leave Authority will require documentation of when the applicant actually performed the work that resulted in the payment (i.e., accrual basis reporting). For example, if the individual performed work in August \u201922 and got paid for it in December \u201822, the earnings would be attributed to the third quarter of 2022.

The CT Paid Leave Authority will also ask the applicant if they are planning to not work at all during the leave period or if they plan to do some work but less than your usual amount. If the applicant is planning to perform some work, the Authority will ask for information about what percentage of the applicant\u2019s average work week they will work. For example, if the applicant plans to work 1/3 of their average work week, the Authority would consider the applicant to be on leave for 2/3 of the week and the benefit payment would be 2/3 of the total weekly benefit.

Yes, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), otherwise known as COVID-19 leave, is different from the Connecticut Paid Leave (CTPL) program. The FFCRA was a law that was in effect in 2020 and required most employers to provide some paid leave to employees who had COVID or could not work due to quarantines or school or daycare closures. \u00a0FFCRA, however, was a time-limited law and is no longer in effect. \u00a0The Paid Family and Medical Leave Act (PFMLA) provides paid leave benefits to employees who cannot work due to their own serious health condition or the serious health condition of a family member. The CTPL does not apply to situations when an employee cannot work due to school or daycare closures. Is a pre-school or nursery school a covered employer?

How can sole proprietors and self-employed make contributions to the Trust Fund if they are not on payroll? Sole proprietors and self-employed individuals may make ACH electronic payments through the CT Paid Leave Authority website. How do I file for employees who reach their FICA limit? When an employee hits their FICA limit, no further contributions should be remitted on their behalf. When remitting via batch, all future submissions for that Employee should have their name and $0 wages. The summarized wages should also be excluding the wages over the FICA limit. How will an employer know how much an employee has earned with another employer? Employers are not required to determine how much an employee has made at other employers because eligibility for job-protected leave does not require wage information. Eligibility for job-protected leave depends on how long the employee worked for that employer. Although eligibility for the Connecticut Paid Leave program involves wage requirements, the CT Paid Leave Authority will be able to obtain wage information from multiple employers through the Department of Labor.

Home How CT Paid Leave Works What is CT Paid Leave? CT Paid Leave allows eligible workers to receive income replacement benefits when they need to take time away from work for qualifying reasons . Keep in mind that CT Paid Leave does not provide job protection - that is the purpose of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), the Connecticut Family and Medical Leave Act (CT FMLA) and the Connecticut Family Violence Leave Act. Types of Leave Continuous Leave An absence taken as a consecutive span of time for a single qualifying reason. Intermittent Leave A leave in separate, non-consecutive time periods rather than a single span of time for a single qualifying reason. Reduced Schedule A leave schedule that reduces an  employee\u2019s usual number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday for a period of time, normally from a full-time schedule to a part-time schedule. Is CT Paid Leave job protected? CT Paid Leave provides income replacement benefits for qualifying reasons, but it does not provide job protected time away from work. CT Paid Leave and FMLA Which businesses must participate? Which workers are eligible? CT Paid Leave applies to most employers with one or more workers in Connecticut. Coverage and Eligibility What are the worker contributions? CT Paid Leave is funded through a small contribution of 0.5% from worker paychecks. Contributions How do employers submit contributions? Employers are required to deduct the 0.5% worker contribution via payroll deductions and remit these contributions quarterly to the CT Paid Leave Authority.

Under federal and CT FMLA, the employer cannot require the employee to take more job-protected leave than the employee needs. The CT FMLA regulations state \u201cThere is no limit on the size of an increment of leave when an employee takes intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule. However, an employer may limit leave increments to the shortest period of time that the employer\u2019s payroll system uses to account for absences or use of leave, provided it is one hour or less.\u201d [31-51qq-14(d)] The federal FMLA regulations have a similar standard; however, the federal FMLA regulations state that even if the payroll system can account for absences of less than 15 minutes, the employer can opt to establish 15 minutes as the minimum increment of leave. Both federal FMLA and CT FMLA state that it is the employer\u2019s choice as to whether to allow intermittent leave for bonding. Employers must notify their employees about their policy. In terms of CT Paid Leave, if an employee who is eligible for CT Paid Leave benefits reports that they need income replacement in connection with intermittent absences for a covered reason, the CT Paid Leave Authority will pay income replacement benefits based on the reported time off, to the minute. Claimants must notify CT Paid Leave within two days of each intermittent absence. Need More Help?

{"id": "3c795fec1398-6", "text": "For this calculation, the CT Paid Leave Authority will require documentation of when the applicant actually performed the work that resulted in the payment (i.e. accrual basis reporting). Note: Benefits are capped at 60 times the current minimum wage. Sixty times the minimum wage between June 1, 2023 and December 31, 2023 was $900.00. As of January 1, 2024, sixty times the minimum wage is $941.40. VIEW BENEFIT PAYMENT EXAMPLES I need to take leave, but I can't completely abandon my business. Can I submit a claim for partial benefits? If you are planning to perform some work, we will ask for information about what percentage of your average work week you will work. For example, if you plan to work 1/3 of your average work week, we will consider you to be on leave for 2/3 of the week and your benefit payment would be 2/3 of the total weekly benefit. If, while you are on leave, you receive payment for work that you performed before the leave, your CT Paid Leave benefits would not be reduced. The CT Paid Leave Authority may ask for details for those payments to verify when the work was performed, to ensure it does not inappropriately reduce the leave benefits. Need More Help?

These dates can be revised during the application process as necessary. Qualifying Reasons Inform your employer Inform your employer/human resources department about the need for leave. Let them know that you will be applying for CT Paid Leave income replacement benefits. You must ask your employer for job protected leave under FMLA.

This notice is necessary in order for the Authority to adequately prepare to intake requests for paid leave from the employee population. Failure to provide adequate notice of the intent to terminate the private plan or failure to retain private plan coverage for the full 3-year period may result in penalties. Penalties are in addition to contributions owed for coverage under the public plan. Employers cannot take deductions from employees to pay penalties. Involuntary The CT Paid Leave Authority may deny or withdraw approval for a private plan if it determines that the employer has: Threatened or coerced employees in connection with the private plan vote Failed to pay benefits Failed to pay benefits timely and in a manner consistent with the public plan Failed to maintain an adequate surety bond as required by the CT Insurance Department (CID) Misused private plan funds Failed to submit reports as required Provided materially false information to the CT Paid Leave Authority or the CT Insurance Department (CID) or failed to comply with sections 31-49e to 31-49t , inclusive of the Connecticut General Statutes Has directed or permitted its insurer or Third-Party Administrator to engage in such actions If the Authority terminates the private plan for any reason, it will indicate the date that such termination will occur.\u00a0 Coverage under the public plan will begin on the first day following the last day that coverage was in force under the private plan.

Voluntary Terminations Failure to provide at least 90 days\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 notice of intent to terminate may result in a penalty of up to 100% of the contributions owed for the first calendar quarter that coverage is in force under the public program. Failure to maintain private plan coverage during the entire 3-year period may result in a penalty of up to 300% of the contributions owed for the first calendar quarter that coverage is in force under the public program. If the Authority finds that reasonable efforts were made to maintain private plan coverage but such efforts were unsuccessful, it may reduce the penalty by one third. For example, if private plan coverage was sought under a different insurance carrier, but the employees voted against the new plan, that may qualify as a reasonable effort. Involuntary Terminations If the Authority requires a private plan to terminate, it may assess a penalty of up to 400% of the contributions owed for the first calendar quarter that coverage is in force under the public program.

Duration of benefits for Military Caregiver Leave Pursuant to both federal FMLA and CT FMLA, up to 26 weeks of job protected leave are available for military caregivers.

Minimum earnings The second requirement for CT Paid Leave eligibility is that you have earned at least $2,325 from a covered employer in the highest-earning quarter of the first four of the five most recently completed quarters (the \u201dbase period\u201d) and (1) you are currently employed or have been employed within the last 12 weeks by a covered employer, or (2) you are a Connecticut resident who is self-employed or a sole proprietor who enrolled in the program.

There are 6 qualifying reasons to apply for CT Paid Leave. VIEW QUALIFYING REASONS Frequently Asked Questions Who determines eligibility for wage replacement benefits? The CT Paid Leave Authority administers the Paid Leave program and, with its Claims Administrator, will determine an applicant's eligibility for benefits as well as the amount of benefits the applicant may receive. The employer does not make this determination. If I live in Connecticut but work for an out-of-state employer, can I participate in CT Paid Leave? Only employees who work in Connecticut can participate in CT Paid Leave. If an employer is paying unemployment insurance for an employee to the CT Department of Labor, that is evidence the employee works in Connecticut. An employee who lives in Connecticut but works in another state is not eligible to participate in the CT Paid Leave program but may be eligible to participate in a paid leave program offered by the state where he or she works. I am a per diem employee.  Do I have to participate in and contribute to the paid leave program? Yes.

CTPL CT Paid Leave/Connecticut Paid Leave Enrollment File The Enrollment file conveys the association between your business,               as a TPA, and your client employers. To establish a               company-to-company relationship in our system the Enrollment File               requires Federal Employer Identification Numbers (FEIN) as               identifiers for the participating client employers. We recognize               that business relationships between your business and client               employers may change over time. Enrollment files are also used to               provide the date you start remitting to CTPL on behalf of the               client employer and the end date for when you will no longer be               remitting to CTPL on behalf of the client employer. While the               preferred format for Enrollment Files is XML, an alternate CSV               format can be used by TPAs who are unable to produce XML.

A serious health condition is an illness, injury or impairment or physical or mental condition that involves inpatient care or continuing treatment. Inpatient Care is defined as an overnight stay in a hospital, hospice, or residential medical care facility. This includes any period of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with the overnight stay. Note: Even if the surgery is elective, it counts as a serious health condition if an overnight stay in the hospital is required. What is NOT considered a serious health condition? The following ailments are NOT considered to be a \u201cserious health condition\u201d unless complications develop such that inpatient care or continuing treatment, as defined above, is required: routine physical examinations common cold flu earaches upset stomach minor ulcers headaches, other than migraines routine dental work or orthodontia problems periodontal disease cosmetic treatments, such as most treatments for acne or outpatient plastic surgery Note: Restorative dental or plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are serious health conditions provided all the other conditions are met.

Claims Frequently Asked Questions Can an employee apply for CT Paid Leave benefits if they have been exposed to or diagnosed with COVID-19 or a similar illness? Simply being exposed to COVID-19 or even being diagnosed with COVID-19 is not necessarily a serious health condition as defined by CT Paid Leave. Therefore, it is not necessarily a qualifying reason for income replacement benefits under CT Paid Leave. An eligible worker may receive CT Paid Leave benefits in connection with an exposure to or diagnosis with COVID-19 only if they can provide medical documentation from their health care provider demonstrating that the COVID-19 exposure/diagnosis results in the person having a condition that rises to the definition of a \"serious health condition\". The elements of the definition of a \"serious health condition\" that are most likely to apply are as follows: The condition requires an overnight stay in a hospital or other medical care facility; or The condition incapacitates the employee (for example, unable to work) for more than three consecutive days and that include ongoing medical treatment (either multiple appointments with a health care provider, or a single appointment and follow-up care, such as prescription medication) or, The condition results in or exacerbates a chronic condition that causes occasional periods when the employee is incapacitated, and which require treatment by a health care provider at least twice a year. Similarly, an eligible worker may receive CT Paid Leave benefits because they need to serve as a caregiver to a family member who was exposed to or diagnosed with COVID-19 only if the family member\u2019s health care provider certifies that the family member\u2019s exposure/diagnosis results in the family member having a serious health condition.

{"id": "e474ef871350-2", "text": "Home How CT Paid Leave Works Contributions How do CT Paid Leave Contributions Work? Employers deduct 0.5% from an employee's pay. Employers remit these contributions to the CT Paid Leave Authority, where they are pooled into a trust from which benefit payments are made.\u00a0 Example: If you earn $1,000 per week, your contribution to CT Paid Leave is $5 per week. Is There a Cap on Contributions? Employees contribute until they reach the Social Security contribution limit . If an employee works for more than one employer, each employer will be required to continue remitting the contributions until the employee reaches the Social Security contribution limit with that employer. If this process results in an overpayment of contributions, the employee may apply to the CT Paid Leave Authority for a refund of the overpayment. If you believe that you over contributed last year, please submit your refund request using our Contact Us form. When filling out the form, select \u201cEmployee Overpayment Reimbursement\u201d as the contact reason. Overpayment reimbursements can only be processed with proof of year-end earnings; therefore, we cannot process for the current year. Can I Opt-Out of CT Paid Leave Contributions? If you work for a covered employer in Connecticut, you are required to contribute 0.5% of your income up to the Social Security contribution limit. Individuals may not opt-out of CT Paid Leave.
