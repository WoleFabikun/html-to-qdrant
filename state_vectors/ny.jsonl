Requesting Paid Family Leave is easy.\u00a0Start by planning your leave: Leave can be taken either all at once or intermittently, but must be taken in full-day increments. You must notify your employer at least 30 days before the start of leave if foreseeable; otherwise, notify them as soon as possible. Employees who hold more than one job may take Paid Family Leave from both jobs, but they must do so with both employers at the same time. Important notes regarding intermittent leave: The maximum number of leave days you can take is based on the average number of days you work per week. For example, if you work an average of three days per week, you can take a maximum of 36 days of Paid Family Leave (3 days x 12 weeks). If you take intermittent leave and more than three months pass between days of Paid Family Leave, your next day or period of PFL is considered a new claim under the law.

If you are denied or partially denied for Paid Family Leave, your insurance carrier (or employer, if self-insured) must provide you with the reason for denial and information about requesting arbitration, or you can visit the arbitrator\u2019s website at https://nyspfla.namadr.com . You may also request arbitration for any other PFL claim-related disputes, such as timeliness of the carrier\u2019s payment or denial.

File a Complaint Additional Anti-discrimination Laws There are other state and federal laws that protect\u00a0employees from discrimination. If you think that you have experienced discrimination based on a ground protected under one of the following laws, then you may be able to file a discrimination claim with the State Division of Human Rights, United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the NYS Department of Labor, or your local human rights commission: The New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) prohibits employers from discriminating against employees and job applicants based on certain protected grounds, including age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military status, sex, disability, pregnancy-related conditions, gender identity, predisposing genetic characteristics, familial status, marital status, or domestic violence victim status.

The New York State Labor Law explicitly prohibits employers from discriminating or retaliating against employees because they have used any legally protected absence pursuant to federal, local, or state law. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires employers with 15 or more employees to provide reasonable accommodations to workers with disabilities and makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against workers with disabilities. You should also check your local laws for additional anti-discrimination protections.\u00a0 For example, the New York City Human Rights Law protects employees in New York City from discrimination based on similar protected classes.

How to Apply Alternative Text Alternative Text Paid Family Leave FAQ: If I have a qualifying event, when should I apply? Requesting Paid Family Leave is easy.\u00a0Start by planning your leave: Leave can be taken either all at once or intermittently, but must be taken in full-day increments. You must notify your employer at least 30 days before the start of leave if foreseeable; otherwise, notify them as soon as possible. Employees who hold more than one job may take Paid Family Leave from both jobs, but they must do so with both employers at the same time. Important notes regarding intermittent leave: The maximum number of\u00a0leave days you can take is based on the average number of days you work per week. For example, if you work an average of three days per week, you can take a maximum of 36 days of Paid Family Leave (3 days x 12 weeks). If you take intermittent leave and more than three months pass between days of Paid Family Leave, your next day or period of PFL is considered a new claim under the law. This means you will need to submit a new Request for Paid Family Leave.

Special Employment General and Special Employment (with more than one employer) Who is responsible for providing Paid Family Leave coverage in situations where there is both general and special employment? Employees in certain industries may have more than one employer. Under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, a general employee of one employer may be a special employee of another. The general employer pays the employees\u2019 wages and may provide required employee benefits. The special employer takes control of the employee for a limited time. If there is a dispute over who is responsible for Paid Family Leave benefits, general employment is presumed to continue but the special employer would also be liable. While the parties may contract between themselves concerning the scope of their responsibilities, the NYS Workers\u2019 Compensation Board would determine the liable employer if there is a dispute.", "keywords": ["seasonal workers", "pool lifeguard", "employer restart", "seasonal", "paid", "employees", "regular schedule", "regular schedule", "\u2019 t", "consecutive weeks", "additional information", "domestic", "january", "domestic workers", "private homeowner", "private homeowner", "paid", "consecutive weeks", "employment", "employment", "who", "paid", "special employment", "employees", "certain industries", "compensation", "general employee", "special employee", "general employer", "employees \u2019 wages", "employee benefits", "special employer", "paid", "general employment", "special employer", "nys", "compensation", "liable employer"]}
{"id": "cabb411ad1b0-5", "text": "A general and special employer may decide between them to designate full responsibility for Paid Family Leave to the general employer. However, absent an agreement otherwise, the general and special employers may both be found liable. For example, if an employee works for a motion picture project employer (MPPE) as a general employee, and a certain film production company as a special employee, the MPPE may collect employee contributions and provide paid family leave benefits to the employee through its insurance policy, but the special employer also remains liable for compliance absent an agreement providing otherwise or the general employer maintaining control. How is eligibility determined in general and special employment situations? There is a relatively long period for employees to acquire eligibility for Paid Family Leave (26 weeks for employees working 20 or more hours per week). An employee\u2019s entire work history with the general employer would count toward their eligibility if the general employer is providing benefits and where the general employer maintains control over the employee. In addition, an employee\u2019s work history with the special employer while on the general employer\u2019s payroll applies toward eligibility when the special employer maintains control. How should matters of reinstatement be addressed? The general and special employer should make clear to the employee the general and special employers\u2019 responsibilities concerning the employee\u2019s reinstatement. Can You Opt Out? Paid Family Leave is not optional for eligible employees. Coverage can only be waived if: You regularly work\u00a020 hours or more per week, but you won't be in employment with that employer for 26 consecutive weeks; or You regularly work fewer\u00a0than 20 hours per week and you will not work 175 days in a 52-week period. Employers must offer a waiver to employees who qualify for one. If you\u00a0waive\u00a0coverage, you\u00a0will not make contributions and will not be eligible for Paid Family Leave benefits.

This includes biological siblings, adopted siblings, stepsiblings and half-siblings. These family members can live outside of New York State, and even outside of the country. Read on to learn how Paid Family Leave may be able to help you and your family in 2024. Up to 12 weeks of leave New York State Paid Family Leave provides eligible employees with up to 12 weeks of job protected, paid time off to bond with a new child, care for a family member with a serious health condition, or to assist loved ones when a family member is deployed abroad on active military service. This time can be taken all at once, or in increments of full days. Paid Family Leave may also be available in some situations when an employee or their minor, dependent child is under an order of quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. (See the COVID-19 quarantine leave page for full details.) At 67% of pay (up to a cap) Employees taking Paid Family Leave receive 67% of their average weekly wage, up to a cap of 67% of the current New York State Average Weekly Wage (NYSAWW).

Same strong protections Employees can take leave to care for their family members knowing New York has their backs. With some of the nation\u2019s strongest worker protections, New York State Paid Family Leave guarantees that: Employees have job protection, ensuring they can return to the same job (or a comparable one) when they return from Paid Family Leave. Employees can keep their health insurance while on leave on the same terms they had while working. Employers are prohibited from discriminating or retaliating against employees for requesting or taking Paid Family Leave. And as New York continues to look out for some of our most vulnerable workers, citizenship is never a factor in eligibility for New York Paid Family Leave. Fully funded by employees (at a lower rate than last year!) New York State Paid Family Leave is insurance that may be funded by employees through payroll deductions. Even though benefits are expanding to cover more family members this year, the contribution rate has gone down. For 2024, employees will contribute 0.373% of their gross wages per pay period. The maximum annual contribution for 2024 is $333.25. This is $66.18 less than 2023 .
