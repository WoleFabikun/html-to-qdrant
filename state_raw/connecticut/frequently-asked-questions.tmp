Thus, Lee has received 11 weeks of CTPL benefits in the 12-month period and only has one week of CTPL benefits available.

Sole Proprietor Benefit Flow</u></b><br>Sole Proprietors and self-employed individuals must pay deductions for the full quarter in which they have registered. The earliest that a sole proprietor or self-employed individual is eligible to receive paid leave benefits is the first day of the month following three (3) full calendar months from the date that they registered. They may start their claim 30 days before the first day for which they are requesting benefits.<br><br><u>An example:</u>

<b><u>2. Sole Proprietor Rules</u></b><br><b><u>Background:</u></b><br>Under the CT Paid Leave Act, a self-employed individual or sole proprietor may choose to enroll in the CT Paid Leave Program. If they enroll, they must remain in the program for at least three years. Under the statute, an enrolled self-employed individual/sole proprietor must contribute .5% of their self-employment income (capped at an amount equal to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbbdet.html">Social Security</a> Wage Base)on a quarterly basis. We define “self-employment income” the same way the federal IRS defined self-employment income for purposes of filing federal self-employment taxes (26 USC 1402(b)). We rely on Line 31 of the individual's Schedule C or line 6 of the Schedule SE (depending on the tax form filed) to determine sole-proprietor eligibility and benefits.<br><br><b><u>Contributions:</u></b><br>Some self-employed individuals or sole proprietors report their self-employment income to the IRS using cash basis accounting while others use accrual basis accounting. Cash basis focuses on when the individual actually receives payment while accrual basis focuses on when the individual performed the work. For example, if the individual performed work in December ’22 and got paid for it in January ‘23, with cash basis accounting, the income would be reported and the .5% contribution would be attributed to the first quarter of 2023.&nbsp; With accrual basis accounting, on the other hand, the income would be reported and the .5% contribution would be attributed to the last quarter of 2022. Regardless of the specific date on which you register, contributions will be owed for the full quarter in which you registered, and each quarter thereafter.<br><br>Because of the way self-employment income is defined by the IRS, some self-employed individuals/sole proprietors make estimated quarterly payments toward their self-employment taxes but others may not be able to determine their actual self-employment income until they calculate their taxes at the end of the year. Accordingly, the CT Paid Leave Authority will allow enrolled self-employed individuals/sole proprietors to report their income and remit their contributions in one of two ways:
<ul><li style="font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 1.5em;">Report their quarterly income and remit the .5% using the same calculations they use to make their estimated quarterly payments toward their self-employment taxes, and reconcile the contributions when they finalize their self-employment taxes at year end; or</li><li style="font-size: 13px !important;line-height: 1.5em;">Report their quarterly income as $0 and remit no contributions until they calculate their self-employment taxes at year end, at which time they will report their self-employment income for the year to CT Paid Leave and remit the .5% contributions for the year.</li></ul>
Whether a quarterly estimated payment is made or $0.00 has been reported until the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter, the full year’s contributions must be paid in full by the January 31 deadline for timely payments for the 4<sup>th</sup> quarter.<br><br><b><u>Determining Eligibility:</u></b><br>The CT Paid Family Leave Act sets the rules for how the CT Paid Leave Authority determines if an employee is eligible for CT Paid Leave benefits and, if so, how to calculate those benefits. To determine eligibility, we have to look at <u>the first four of the five most recently completed quarters</u> at the time of the application and see if the applicant earned at least $2325 in the highest earning quarter of the four. Because the CT Paid Leave Authority can only consider wages earned in CT – or for a sole proprietor – earned while residing in CT, if you applied for benefits any time between January 1 and March 31, 2022, we would only be able to consider the income you earned in the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of 2022 (July 1 through September 30, 2022). Because the statute requires the Authority to consider earnings per quarter, the CT Paid Leave Authority will require documentation of <u>when the applicant actually performed the work</u> that resulted in the payment (i.e., accrual basis reporting). For example, if the individual performed work in August ’22 and got paid for it in December ‘22, the earnings would be attributed to the third quarter of 2022. We apply this rule for determining eligibility, regardless of whether you use the accrual basis or cash basis for your taxes.<br><br><b><u>Calculating Benefits:</u></b><br>If you meet the eligibility requirements, the CT Paid Leave Act specifies that we need to calculate your benefits by first determining your base weekly earnings. The base weekly earnings are calculated by (1) again looking at the <u>first four of the five most recently completed quarters</u>, (2) adding together the money earned while you resided in CT in the two highest earning quarters, and (3) dividing that sum by 26. For this calculation, the CT Paid Leave Authority will require documentation of <u>when the applicant actually performed the work</u> that resulted in the payment (i.e. accrual basis reporting).<br><br><b><u>Calculating Your Workweek:</u></b><br>Under the CT Paid Leave statute, an eligible individual can receive income replacement benefits for up to 12 weeks for most qualifying reasons.&nbsp; A week is determined based on each applicant’s regular work schedule.&nbsp; In order to calculate the work schedule of a self-employed individual/sole proprietor, the CT Paid Leave Authority will request documentation from the applicant regarding their average number of hours they typically work in a week. The CT Paid Leave Authority will also ask the applicant if they are planning to not work at all during the leave period or if they plan to do some work but less than your usual amount. If the applicant is planning to perform some work, the Authority will ask for information about what percentage of the applicant’s average work week they will work. For example, if the applicant plans to work 1/3 of their average work week, the Authority would consider the applicant to be on leave for 2/3 of the week and the benefit payment would be 2/3 of the total weekly benefit. If, while an individual is on leave, they receive payment for work that they performed before the leave, that payment would not reduce the benefits that they receive. The CT Paid Leave Authority may request details for those payments, verifying the timing of the work performed, to ensure it does not inappropriately reduce the leave benefits.<br>&nbsp;</span></lightning-formatted-rich-text><br></div><div class="slds-p-left_large slds-m-bottom_medium"><h6>What are the reasons for taking Pregnancy/Childbirth leave?</h6><br><lightning-formatted-rich-text class="slds-rich-text-editor__output"><span part="formatted-rich-text"><b>Pregnancy/Childbirth leave may be taken for the following reasons</b>:

If an employee is paying UI into more than 1 state, the employee should encourage their employer to work with the appropriate state Dept. of Labor to correct the situation.</span></lightning-formatted-rich-text><br></div><div class="slds-p-left_large slds-m-bottom_medium"><h6>If a self-employed individual or sole proprietor enrolls in the CT Paid Leave Program, what are they required to contribute?</h6><br><lightning-formatted-rich-text class="slds-rich-text-editor__output"><span part="formatted-rich-text">A self-employed individual or sole proprietor who enrolls in the CT Paid Leave Program is required to contribute 0.5% of his or her "self employment income", as defined by the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C 1402(b). The CT Paid Leave Authority will allow enrolled self-employed individuals/sole proprietors to report their income and remit their contributions in one of two ways: Report their quarterly income and remit the .5% using the same calculations they use to make their estimated quarterly payments toward their self-employment taxes, and reconcile the contributions when they finalize their self-employment taxes at year end; or Report their quarterly income as 0 and remit no contributions until they calculate their self-employment taxes at year end, at which time they will report their self-employment income for the year to CT Paid Leave and remit the .5% contributions for the year.</span></lightning-formatted-rich-text><br></div><div class="slds-p-left_large slds-m-bottom_medium"><h6>I have a mobile business (as an example, a food truck service).

If an organization is structured such that the owner is categorized as an employee, receiving wages and a W2, then the owner is treated as an employee for purposes of the CT Paid Leave Act. &nbsp;If the organization is structured such that the owner does not receive wages and a W2, but rather, takes a draw or other self-employment income, then the owner is treated as self-employed for purposes of the CT Paid Leave Act with the option to participate within the program.</span></lightning-formatted-rich-text><br></div><div class="slds-p-left_large slds-m-bottom_medium"><h6>I am a per diem employee.

This file will be bulk loaded to our platform.<br><br><b>3</b>) If an employer is supported by a TPA or tax accountant, we still would like the employer to create their <a href="https://ct.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ct.gov</a> account identity and register with CTPL. When they register, they can indicate that they are supported by a TPA for payroll processing. The reason why we want the employer to register is so that we have business contact information in anticipation of the future processes around claim benefits administration.</span></lightning-formatted-rich-text><br></div></slot></div></section></div></lightning-accordion-section><lightning-accordion-section role="listitem" class="slds-accordion__list-item" lwc-3tfn8c53l4v-host=""><div lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="slds-accordion__list-item"><section lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="slds-accordion__section" part="accordion-section"><div lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="slds-accordion__summary"><h2 lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="slds-accordion__summary-heading"><button lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="section-control slds-button slds-button_reset slds-accordion__summary-action" type="button" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="lgt-accordion-section-202" part="button"><lightning-primitive-icon lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" size="x-small"><svg class="slds-button__icon slds-button__icon_left slds-icon slds-icon-text-default slds-icon_x-small" focusable="false" data-key="chevronright" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 520 520" part="icon"><g><path d="M179 44l207 205c6 6 6 16 0 22L179 476c-6 6-16 6-22 0l-22-22c-6-6-6-16 0-22l163-161c6-6 6-16 0-22L136 88c-6-6-6-16 0-22l22-22c6-5 15-5 21 0z"></path></g></svg></lightning-primitive-icon><span lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="slds-accordion__summary-content" title="Private Plan">Private Plan</span></button></h2><slot lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" name="actions"></slot></div><div lwc-3tfn8c53l4v="" class="slds-accordion__content" id="lgt-accordion-section-202" hidden="" aria-hidden="true"><slot lwc-3tfn8c53l4v=""><div class="slds-p-left_large slds-m-bottom_medium"><h6>Can a business have a private plan for some, but not all, employees?</h6><br><lightning-formatted-rich-text class="slds-rich-text-editor__output"><span part="formatted-rich-text">No. A private plan must cover all employees working in Connecticut.
