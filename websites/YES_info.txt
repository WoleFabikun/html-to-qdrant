Your Year-End Statement
To download your year-end statement, you will need your
Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN)
formatted as a 15-digit number
and
the permanent authorization code issued by the Department of Labor (not to be confused with the PIN used to file your NJ-927 and WR-30 with the Division of Revenue).
We only send this code out by mail once to each employer. You will not get a copy this year if we sent it to you in the last two years. If you can't find your code, our Division of Employer Accounts has
instructions on how to retrieve it
.
Remember, you must enter your
FEIN as a 15-digit number.
If your FEIN is fewer than 15 digits, add a zero (0)
before
the first number, and add on five zeros (00000)
after
the last one.
For example, if your FEIN is
123456789
, you must enter it as
0
123456789
00000
.
