Frequently Asked Questions
Debit Card FAQ
Debit Card FAQ
We issue benefit payments to a convenient and secure prepaid debit card
issued by
Money Network/My Banking Direct
, a service of Flagstar Bank, N.A. Here are answers to common questions about how the card works.
For more information, read
the FAQ provided by Money Network/My Banking Direct
(downloadable PDF).
When will I receive my debit card?
If you haven’t received Unemployment, Temporary Disability, or Family Leave Insurance benefits within the last six months - we will mail you a new Money Network/My Banking Direct debit card within 10 days after we approve your application. Benefit payments should be available on your debit card within three business days of a scheduled payment date.
Will I get a new debit card every time I apply for benefits?
Most customers will receive a new debit card every time they apply.
Tip:
Don't immediately throw it away after you stop receiving benefits. The prepaid debit cards are valid for approximately six months after you withdraw all the funds from the card (having $0.00 balance). Should you be approved for Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance benefits again within that six-month period, we can issue benefits on this same debit card account. After six months, you'll be issued a new Money Network/My Banking Direct debit card the next time you apply and are approved for benefits.
How long does it take for money to be on my card?
Once a payment is posted, funds should be available on your debit card within three business days of the payment date.
How is the debit card sent to me?
Your debit card is sent via regular mail in a plain, unmarked envelope with an Omaha, NE return address. It might even look like junk mail. Make sure you check all your mail carefully so you don’t discard it by mistake.
Why does my name appear on the card?
Your name appears on the card because the debit card is issued to you and is linked to your Social Security number and date of birth with
Money Network/My Banking Direct
, a service of Flagstar Bank, N.A.
What time of day can I make withdrawals or purchases with my card?
You can access your money for purchases and withdrawals 24 hours a day. Keep in mind, benefits will be available on your card three business days after each payment date.
What happens if my card is lost, stolen, or damaged?
If your debit card is stolen, or becomes lost or damaged, immediately call Money Network/My Banking Direct at 888-292-0059. There is one free replacement per calendar year. Additional replacement cards cost $10 per card.
Can I transfer funds to my checking or savings account?
You may transfer some or all of your funds to a checking or savings account. Download the Money Network mobile app (for
Apple
and
Android
devices) and go to
Move Money Out
>
Send Money to External Bank Account
or sign into your account at
https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com
and request an Online Funds Transfer.
Can the State of New Jersey track my transactions?
For privacy reasons, the State of New Jersey is not permitted to look at specific card account numbers or transaction details. Only Money Network/My Banking Direct customer service representatives may look at your account history with you.
Who should I call about my debit card account?
Contact Money Network/My Banking Direct toll-free at 888-292-0059. You can also get account information online at
https://mbd.everywherepaycard.com
.
Will I be able to add other funds to my debit card?
Only the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development may deposit funds into your debit card account.
Is there a daily maximum I can withdraw from my debit card account?
Your debit card has no daily withdrawal or purchase limit, so you have full access to your available funds at any time. However, ATM owners determine how much money their ATMs will dispense per transaction, so you may need to make more than one withdrawal.
Will I earn interest on the funds in my debit card account?
This debit card account does not accrue any type of interest.
What happens if I try to make a purchase and there are insufficient funds in my account?
If there are insufficient funds in your account to cover a purchase, the transaction will be denied. There is no transaction fee if you are denied for insufficient funds. Please check your balance before attempting to make any purchase.
Can using the debit card build my credit history or hurt my credit rating?
Since this is not a credit card, no credit check is required for you to receive the card. It’s also not tied to a bank account or credit line, so the debit card account won’t affect your credit rating.
Where can I get a complete list of fees?
A complete schedule of fees is sent with the initial debit card package.

What if I still have a Bank of America debit card from a prior claim?
If you had benefits paid on a Bank of America debit card in the past 18 months, you'll automatically be issued a new Money Network/My Banking Direct debit card.
Your Bank of America debit card will remain active for a few more months so you can use any remaining balance.
Important dates:
Prior to August 26, 2022
, you may use your card as you normally do to spend any remaining funds.
Your card will be deactivated on August 26, 2022.
By September 26
, transfer any remaining funds to your own checking or savings account. Select the “Transfer funds” option when you log in to your Bank of America prepaid card account or use the mobile app.
After September 26
, if you have any funds left in your Bank of America card account, call Bank of America using the number on the back of your card to get the remaining balance sent to you by paper check.
