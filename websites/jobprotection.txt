Job Protection Information
Job Protection Information
Temporary Disability Insurance and Family Leave Insurance are wage replacement programs and they do not provide job protection. However, during the period in which you're receiving these benefits, your job may be protected under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA), or the New Jersey Security and Financial Empowerment Act (SAFE).
Federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.
For more information:

New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA)
If your employer is covered under the NJFLA and you are an eligible employee, then you are generally entitled to up to 12 weeks of job-protected leave to care for a loved one in a two-year period.
For more information on NJFLA, visit

.
New Jersey Security and Financial Empowerment Act (SAFE)
You can receive up to 20 days of unpaid, job protected leave to handle matters related to sexual and domestic violence.

Protection Against Retaliation
In addition, if your employer retaliates against you for taking or seeking to take Temporary Disability or Family Leave Insurance benefits, you have the right to take private legal action.
