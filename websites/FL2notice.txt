Ready to Start Your Bonding Leave?
Ready to Start Your Bonding Leave?
There are two ways you can claim Family Leave Insurance:
1) TRANSITIONAL BONDING CLAIM:
Claim your bonding benefits immediately after your pregnancy and recovery period (Temporary Disability Insurance) ends, with no interruption. If you received an FL2 notice in the mail and have the unique Claim ID Number handy, click the link below "Transition into bonding (FL2)."
2) NEW BONDING CLAIM FOR THOSE WHO:
received pregnancy disability benefits through private insurance/employer
didn't receive pregnancy disability benefits at all
or
postponed their bonding leave to a later date making it non-transitional
You will need to submit a new application for Family Leave Insurance benefits (FL1). Click the link below "Start a new application (FL1)."
Choose which Family Leave path works best for you:
Transitioning into bonding leave right after your NJ Temporary Disability claim ends?
Transition into bonding (FL2)
Postponed your bonding leave or didn't receive NJ Temporary Disability benefits?
