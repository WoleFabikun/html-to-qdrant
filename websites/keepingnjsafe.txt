Temporary Disability benefits are only available if you have an illness, injury, or disability. You may claim up to a maximum of 26 weeks of benefits under this program, for as long as a medical professional will certify. If your loved one is ill, injured, or disabled, and you need to take time off work to care for them, you can apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits for caregiving.

are available to an eligible victim/survivor or the loved one of a victim/survivor.

Allowable uses as a victim/survivor or for supporting a victim/survivor include:
