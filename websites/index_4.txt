About the Program
NJ Temporary Disability Insurance provides cash benefits to employees in New Jersey who are unable to work due to a physical or mental health condition or other disability unrelated to their work, including pregnancy/childbirth recovery.
Click here
to download a printable handout about the program.
Temporary Disability Insurance is a wage replacement program and it does not provide job protection. However, during the period in which an employee receives these benefits, their job may be protected under federal law. In addition, if an employer retaliates against an employee for taking or seeking to take Temporary Disability Insurance benefits, they have the right to take private legal action.

Covered Employees and Employers
Employers must participate in these State public insurance programs and deduct payroll taxes for employees working in NJ, or employers may choose to provide employees coverage through a private insurance plan that meets NJ requirements. The federal government is exempt. Temporary Disability Insurance is optional for local governments (for example, counties, municipalities, and school districts). Generally, employees that work a significant amount of time outside of NJ are not covered, but should still apply to find out if they are eligible.
The Employer's Role
Employers are not required to complete an “employer portion” of the application.
Employers still must:
Display Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance posters in a workplace location clearly visible to employees
Provide written notice of Temporary Disability Insurance when an employee is hired, requests information, or notifies an employer of their need for leave
Report employee’s quarterly earnings to the state. We will use those reported earnings to qualify a claim and establish a weekly benefit amount
Closely monitor all benefits issued to your employees and notify the Division immediately if benefits are being issued incorrectly
Report the taxable portion of Temporary Disability benefits on your employee's W-2 for the preceding calendar year.
Employers can also help their employees understand these programs by providing information - see our
employer toolkit
.
Paid Time Off and Temporary Disability Insurance
Employers may be able to require employees to take paid time off (PTO) before Temporary Disability benefits. It depends on how they meet the requirements of the NJ Earned Sick Leave law. This law requires employers of all sizes to provide full-time, part-time, and temporary employees with up to 40 hours of paid sick time per year so they can care for themselves or a loved one.
Employers who separate NJ Earned Sick Leave from their PTO policy can require employees to take PTO before claiming Temporary Disability Insurance benefits. Employers cannot require them to take time accrued under the NJ Earned Sick Leave law.
Some employers use their PTO policy to follow the NJ Earned Sick Leave law. In this case, the employer may not require an employee to utilize any of their PTO prior to Temporary Disability benefits.
See below for more information on employees of the State of New Jersey and other entities covered as state employers.
Find your scenario below to learn more:
Scenario 1: The employer has an Earned Sick Leave policy in compliance with the law, and a separate paid time off (PTO) policy.
Employees can be required to use PTO before receiving Temporary Disability benefits, but not time accrued under the Earned Sick Leave law.
Scenario 2: The employer groups NJ Earned Sick Leave with their paid time off (PTO) policy.
In this case, all days in the PTO policy must meet the requirements of the Earned Sick Leave law. Employees can’t be required to use any PTO before receiving Temporary Disability benefits. This includes PTO policies that provide more than 40 hours of paid time off.
Scenario 3: The employer only has
NJ Earned Sick Leave
that is compliant with the law.
Employees can’t be required to use any NJ Earned Sick Leave before receiving Temporary Disability benefits.
Scenario 4: Employees of the State of NJ.
The State of NJ may require
employees of the State of New Jersey (including Rutgers, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and other entities who are covered as state employers)
to use only up to two weeks of accrued sick time before receiving Temporary Disability Insurance benefits, although the State of NJ may not require state employees to use their last week of sick time before receiving Temporary Disability Insurance benefits.
Keep in mind, any day that an employee receives full wages in paid time off (or NJ Earned Sick Leave), they cannot also receive Temporary Disability benefits.
This means that if an employee utilizes employer paid time off or NJ Earned Sick Leave first, it will postpone Temporary Disability eligibility, and may reduce the length of time an employee receives Temporary Disability benefits.
Temporary Disability provides up to 85% of an employee’s average weekly wage, while under the NJ Earned Sick Leave law, employers must pay sick time at the regular rate of pay. Learn more about how employees are paid for earned sick leave

What We Need From the Employee
Employees who are unable to work due to an injury, illness, or scheduled surgery should complete the first two sections of the application (Parts A & B.) They must include:
The last day they physically worked
The first day they were unable to work, and under the care of a health care provider
All employment from the past 18 months, with accurate dates and work locations
Dates of any paid time off or other benefits received after the last day they worked
What We Need From You
Since the work history and wages are based solely on your employee's statement and wage record, we need you to oversee this process and assist your employees as needed. You can do this by paying close attention to the
"The Notice of Disability Benefits Charged or Credited" form (DS7-C)
. You will receive this notice each time State Disability Insurance benefit payments are made to your employee(s). The notice is mailed to you on the same day that the employee’s payment posts.
This means we will rely on
you
to check the time frame we issued benefits and compare it to when they worked or received paid time off. Any incorrect payments should be reported to the Division immediately by calling our customer service center at (609) 292-7060 or by faxing a corrected statement (along with the employee's Social Security number) to (609) 984-4138.
We suggest keeping a separate file on each employee receiving Temporary Disability Insurance benefits, and adding the DS-7C received from each benefit payment to it. This way you can keep track of the charges per employee for the life of the claim.
We May Request Additional Information From You
In the event that we do not have enough information to approve a claim based on the reported calendar earnings and the employee's statement, you may be required to provide information. In these cases, you may receive in the mail a
request for information (form E-10)
or
request for additional wage information (form E-20)
. The wage and employment information you provide is required to determine their claim, so
please complete and return this form promptly.
Failure to do so can result in a denial of benefits and a monetary penalty.
Information that we may request from an employer can include:
Federal employment identification numbers
Paid time off, vacation, or sick time used
Any intermittent days an employee worked
Employee’s last date of work
Confirmation of valid wages
Wages paid to your employee during their disability period
Report Temporary Disability Benefits on Your Employee's W-2
Year-end statements for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits are
available online
for employers to download in January for the preceding calendar year. Only a portion of the Temporary Disability Insurance benefits paid are taxable by the federal government (they are not taxed by the State of New Jersey). They are considered third-party sick pay or other wages. We do not issue W-2s to individuals who receive Temporary Disability benefits during the calendar year. It is
your responsibility
to report the taxable information on your employee’s W-2. You should also let your employee know where the information is listed on the W-2.
How the Program Is Funded
New Jersey workers and employers contribute to the cost of the Temporary Disability program.
The contribution rate for employers varies from 0.10% to 0.75%.
For 2023, employers contribute between $41.10 and $308.25 on the first $41,100 earned by each employee during this calendar year.
For 2024, employers contribute between $42.30 and $317.25 on the first $42,300 earned by each employee during this calendar year.
On January 1 of each year, the taxable wage cap changes.
The Minimum Gross Earnings Requirements
When your employee's claim is under review, we consider the gross earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week their disability began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is the newly defined
base year
.
To qualify in 2023, they must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $260 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $13,000 in those four quarters (the base year).
To qualify in 2024, they must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $283 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $14,200 in those four quarters (the base year).

reported earnings from:

How Benefits Are Calculated
First, we calculate the average weekly wage
. We do this by dividing the employee's base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "
base week
" is any week they earn $260 or more.
In 2024, a "
base week
" is any week they earn $283 or more
Now, we can determine the weekly benefit rate.
Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.
In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.
In 2024, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,055 per week.
For example, let’s say Steve's first day of disability is Friday, March 1, 2024. To see how much he would receive weekly on Temporary Disability Insurance, we look at the wages you reported for the first four of the last five completed quarters:
Previous Completed Quarters
Time Frame Covered
Total Earnings
Number of Base Weeks
Quarter 5
10/1/23 - 12/31/23
$5,500
13 base weeks
Quarter 4
7/1/23 - 9/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 3
4/1/23 - 6/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 2
1/1/23 - 3/31/23
$4,000
10 base weeks
Quarter 1
10/1/22 - 12/31/22
$4,200
11 base weeks
Quarters 1 through 4 are the regular base year and the time frame used to calculate his benefits.
Total base year earnings:
$18,200 which we divide by 45 (the number of base weeks)
This gives us an
average weekly wage
of $404.
Steve's weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:
$343.
Illness or Injury
After completing their part of the application, employees must submit a medical certification of the disability that prevent them from working. The medical certificate (also called Part C of the application) must be completed by their health care provider. Employees who file online will be prompted to print a sheet they can give to their health care provider with instructions for completing the medical certificate online.
Pregnancy Claims
Expectant parents may be eligible for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits while they are pregnant and after they deliver. In most cases, a pregnancy disability period starts four weeks before the expected delivery date and ends six weeks after the birth (or eight weeks after a Cesarean section), but the duration can vary depending on the medical evaluation of the parent's condition. Learn more about cash benefits during pregnancy
here
(also
available in Spanish
).
The Medical Professional’s Role
Only an
approved health care provider
can determine whether your employee’s physical condition prevents him or her from being able to work. While your employee is on leave, we require his or her healthcare provider to periodically complete a form confirming that the employee remains under the care of a medical professional and still hasn’t sufficiently recovered to return to work.
In the case of pregnancy, this supplemental form must include the date and type of delivery, the expected date of full recovery, and any complications that may extend the recovery period beyond what we consider customary.
It is your employee’s responsibility to have this form completed by the healthcare provider.
Disclosure of Medical Information
When employees submit an application to us, they authorize their healthcare provider to share their medical information with the Division of Temporary Disability Insurance
only
. We cannot discuss your employee’s condition with you without express written authorization. The Division of Temporary Disability & Family Leave Insurance is not a “
covered entity
” under the federal Health Information Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA).
All of your employee’s medical records, except to the extent necessary to administer the Temporary Disability Insurance benefits law, are confidential and are not open to public inspection. We protect all records that may reveal the identity of your employee.
To protect the integrity of the disability benefits fund, we verify claims and review diagnosis (ICD) codes and the applicant's estimated date of recovery. We use this information to determine whether it is consistent with the normal anticipated duration of the claimed illness, injury, or other disability.

Report employee’s quarterly earnings to the state. We will use those reported earnings to qualify a claim and establish a weekly benefit amount.
Closely monitor all benefits issued to your employees and notify the Division immediately if benefits are being issued incorrectly.
Employers can also help their employees understand these programs by providing information - see our

What We Need From the Employee
Employees who need leave from work in order to care for an ill family member or to bond with a new addition, should complete the first two sections of the application (Parts A & B.) They must include:
The last day they physically worked
The first day their leave began
If they are taking their leave in one continuous period or intermittently up to 56 individual days
All employment from the past 18 months, with accurate dates and work locations
Dates of any paid time off or other benefits received after the last day they worked
What We Need From You
Since the work history and wages are based solely on your employee's statement and wage record, we need you to oversee this process and assist your employees as needed. You can do this by paying close attention to the form (D20) Notice of Eligible Determinations. This form notifies you that your employee’s Family Leave application has been approved. The front of the form has important information about the employee’s benefits. The back lists the payment schedule, taxes, and reasons benefits could be reduced.
This means we will rely on
you
to check the time frame we issued benefits and compare it to the days they reported to work or received paid time off. Any incorrect payments should be reported to the Division immediately by calling our customer service center at (609) 292-7060 or by faxing a corrected statement (along with the employee's Social Security number) to (609) 984-4138.

How Benefits Are Calculated
First, we calculate the average weekly wage
. We do this by dividing the employee's base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "
base week
" is any week they earn $260 or more.
In 2024, a "
base week
" is any week they earn $283 or more.
Now, we can determine the weekly benefit rate.
Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.
In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.
In 2024, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,055 per week.
For example, let’s say Steve's first day of disability is Friday, March 1, 2024. To see how much he would receive weekly on Temporary Disability Insurance, we look at the wages you reported for the first four of the last five completed quarters:
Previous Completed Quarters
Time Frame Covered
Total Earnings
Number of Base Weeks
Quarter 5
10/1/23 - 12/31/23
$5,500
13 base weeks
Quarter 4
7/1/23 - 9/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 3
4/1/23 - 6/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 2
1/1/23 - 3/31/23
$4,000
10 base weeks
Quarter 1
10/1/22 - 12/31/22
$4,200
11 base weeks
Quarters 1 through 4 are the regular base year and the time frame used to calculate his benefits.
Total base year earnings:
$18,200 which we divide by 45 (the number of base weeks)
This gives us an
average weekly wage
of $404.
Steve’s weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:
$343.
If Steve is taking his leave on a day to day basis, he will receive 1/7 of his weekly benefit rate for each day he claims: $49 per day.
How the Program Is Funded
The Family Leave program is financed 100% by worker payroll deductions. Employers do not contribute to the program.
For 2023, workers contribute 0.06% on the first $156,800 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2023 is $94.08.
For 2024, workers contribute 0.09% on the first $161,400 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2024 is $145.26.
The taxable wage cap changes each year.
Bonding Claims
Individuals may be eligible for Family Leave Insurance benefits to bond with a child during the first 12 months after the child’s birth, adoption, or placement. To bond with a newborn, your employee must be the baby’s biological parent, or the biological parent’s domestic partner or civil union partner. Family Leave benefit days can be taken in one continuous period of 12 consecutive weeks or on a day to day basis up to eight weeks (56 individual days) to suit the employee's needs. They can claim Family Leave Insurance benefits to bond for as many or as few days at a time, up to the maximum days available. Medical documentation is not required for bonding claims.
Learn more about cash benefits during bonding
here
.
Care Claims
Individuals may be eligible for Family Leave Insurance benefits to care for a family member with a serious health condition. A health care provider must certify the condition and that the patient requires care. Family caregivers may take leave in one continuous 12-week period, or on a day to day basis up to 56 individual days to suit their needs. That means your employees can take as many or as few days at a time, up to the maximum available, during the 12-month period starting with the first date of leave.
“Family member” means:
parents
spouse
children of any age
parents-in-law
siblings
grandparents
grandchildren
domestic partners
any other individuals related by blood
any other individuals with whom the employee considers to be family
A “serious health condition” means an illness, injury, impairment, or physical or mental condition that requires inpatient care in a hospital, hospice, or residential health care facility, or continuing treatment or continuing supervision by a health care provider.
Learn more about cash benefits for caregiving
here
.
The Medical Professional’s Role
The health care provider determines whether the patient’s physical or mental health condition requires physical care or emotional support from a family member. In some cases, more than one person may receive Family Leave Insurance benefits to care for the same family member.
Disclosure of Medical Information
When patients sign a Family Leave Insurance benefits application, they authorize their doctor to share their medical information with their caregivers and the Division of Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance. We cannot discuss your employee’s family member’s condition without express written authorization. The Division of Temporary Disability & Family Leave Insurance is not a “
covered entity
” under the federal Health Information Portability & Accountability Act (HIPAA).
All of a patient’s medical records, except to the extent necessary to administer the Temporary Disability Benefits Law, are confidential and are not open to public inspection. We protect all records that may reveal the identity of the patient.
To protect the integrity of the family leave benefits fund, we verify claims and review
diagnosis (ICD) codes
and the care recipient's estimated date of recovery. We use this information to determine whether it is consistent wtih the normal anticipated duration of the claimed illness, injury, or other disability.
About the Program
The Temporary Disability Benefits Law allows employers the option of choosing to establish a private plan for the payment of temporary disability or family leave insurance in place of paying benefits under the State Plan. All private plans must be approved by the Division of Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance before they become effective. Private Plan Operations is responsible for the approval process. This office also oversees the administration of private plan policies and the processing and payment of private plan benefits.
At a minimum, approved private plans must meet the basic provisions required of State Plan. Under a private plan:
Benefits paid must be at least equal to the amount that would be paid on a State Plan claim.
Eligibility requirements cannot be more restrictive than they would be for a State Plan claim.
Coverage must be at least equal to that offered by the State Plan.
Neither the employer, nor their workers are required to contribute to the State's Temporary Disability Insurance Trust Fund while the private plan remains in existence. The cost to the worker for the private plan cannot be more than it would be under State Plan.
A written election must be held, unless waived, if the plan is contributory and covers members of a Collective Bargaining Agreement.  A majority of employees must agree to the plan prior to the effective date of the plan.
Plan Approval
Private plans can be established in three ways:
Through an insurance company. All insurance companies must be approved by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and Private Plan Operations to provide coverage for temporary disability insurance before they can write private plan policies. Information for
New Insurers
.
By establishing a
self-insured
plan. The employer is responsible for administering the plan and paying benefits.
Through a union welfare fund. The union welfare fund is responsible for administering the plan and paying benefits.
Modifying An Approved Private Plan
Once a private plan has been approved, it is possible to make changes through the modification process. All modifications must be approved by Private Plan Operations before they can take effect.
The plan must go through the modification process if:
You decide to change insurance carriers.
There is a change in the class of employees covered by the plan.
There are any changes made to the eligibility requirements.
There are any changes made in benefits.
This is a general list of possible modifications. It is not all inclusive. If you have any questions about changes that may require modifying a private plan, contact the Private Plan Unit.
How To Terminate An Existing Private Plan
A private plan can be terminated by:
The employer.
To have an approved private plan terminated, the employer must request termination of the plan in writing. The effective date of the termination will be 30 days after the postmark date of the letter. If the employer would like to request a specific termination date they may do so, but the termination request must be postmarked at least 30 days prior to the termination date. The termination request must state how and when the employees affected were notified that the plan would be terminated, include the NJ Employer Identification Number and be signed by a corporate officer. Mail the termination request to the Private Plan Compliance Section, Plan Approval Unit, PO Box 957, Trenton, NJ 08625.
Additional information regarding this termination process can be directed to the Plan Approval Unit at (609) 292-2720.
Once the plan is terminated, the employer and insurer will receive a "Certificate of Withdrawal" of the private plan and the employer will automatically be put back into the State Plan for disability coverage.
Information pertaining to the employer's cost under the State Plan can be found on the Department's website at
Employer Accounts
or by calling Employer Accounts at (609) 633-6400.
The insurer.
If the plan is being terminated due to nonpayment of the premium, notification to Private Plan Operations must be made in writing at least 15 days before the effective date of the termination.
If termination by the insurer is for any other reason, written notice must be submitted to Private Plan Operations at least 60 days prior to the effective date of the termination. However, if the termination is due to a change of insurer, the 60 day requirement may be waived.
The workers covered by plan.
This requires a petition signed by at least 10 percent of the employees covered by the private plan. Private Plan Operations would then oversee an election in which the covered employees would vote on terminating the plan. The plan will be terminated if a simple majority of the workers covered by the plan vote for its discontinuance.
The Division of Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance.
Should Private Plan Operations determine that there is just cause to terminate a private plan, that plan may be terminated immediately. Should this occur, all parties would be given notice of the termination.
With the exception of termination due to a change in insurer, the workers would automatically be covered by the state plan effective the day following termination. No application forms are required to begin state plan coverage.

Private Plan Claims Processing
The Division of Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance oversees the handling of private plan claims through the Claims Review Unit of Private Plan Operations. All claimants who are denied private plan benefits must be notified of the denial in writing by the insurer, self-insured employer or union welfare fund. The notification must state the reason for denial, and must advise the claimant of his or her right of appeal. A copy of the denial, together with a copy of the claim file, must be submitted to Private Plan Operations.
Under the Law, the claimant may appeal the denial of a private plan claim within one year from the date of the beginning of disability. Appeals are heard by the Private Plan Hearing Officer, whose decision is binding. Further appeals must be presented to the New Jersey Superior Court.
The Claims Review Unit also resolves claim discrepancies, handles claimant complaints and provides assistance and information to all private plan employers, insurers and claimants. To submit copies of denials or to obtain claims assistance, contact the Private Plan Unit.
Private Plan Claims Manual
Click here
to download a printable PDF copy of the Private Plan Claims Manual, a guide to processing Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance benefits under an approved Private Plan.
This manual has been prepared by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development, Private Plan Compliance Section, as a guide to the processing of New Jersey short-term non-work-related claims.
It is intended for use by insurance companies, employers, union welfare funds, and claims consultants who process and pay New Jersey temporary disability and/or family leave claims under approved Private Plans.
This manual describes the benefits and eligibility conditions for approved Private Plans that are equal to the State Plan in every way. If a Private Plan is more liberal than the State Plan, the more liberal provisions in the Private Plan must be used to process actual claims.
The material in the manual is based on the New Jersey Temporary Disability Benefits Law (R.S. 43:21-25 through 43:21-56), the New Jersey Administrative Code (N.J.A.C. 12:18-1.1 through 12:18-3.9 and 1:12A-1.1 through 1:12A-15.2), and portions of the New Jersey Unemployment Compensation Law, Workers' Compensation Law, State Income Tax Law, and No-Fault Automobile Insurance Law. Decisions issued by the New Jersey Supreme Court and Superior Court, policies established by this Department, and our own experience in the area of short-term disability or family leave claims processing also served as a basis for this material.
This manual is published for informational purposes only, and does not have the effect of law, regulation, or ruling.
