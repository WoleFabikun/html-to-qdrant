How The Employer Role Has Changed
How The Employer Role Has Changed
Your role in the application process has changed.
You may not be as involved as you were in the past in submitting your employee's application, but your role as a reliable resource is now more important than ever!
We moved to an alternate way of calculating your employees' claims. Good news! It requires less effort from you on the front end, but we'll need you to keep a watchful eye on any benefits approved to your employees.
It All Starts with You
As you report your employees' quarterly earnings to the state, we will use those reported earnings to qualify a claim and establish a weekly benefit amount. A claim will no longer be based on the weekly earnings immediately before their leave, but on the earnings you report for the previous calendar quarters.
We May Still Need Your Help
In the event that we do not have enough information to approve a claim based on the reported calendar earnings or the employee's statement, you may be required to provide information. In these cases, you may receive in the mail a
request for information (form E-10)
or
request for additional wage information (form E-20).
The wage and employment information you provide is required to determine their claim, so
please complete and return this form promptly.
Failure to do so can result in a denial of benefits and a monetary penalty.
Questions You May Have
Temporary Disability Insurance
Family Leave Insurance
Do my employees still need to print out the E01-Employer Statement instructional notice?
No, the new application only requires information from the employee and the healthcare provider (if applicable). We are getting all required employment information from your employee. The employee will still need to print out the M01-instructional sheet to give to their healthcare provider or the care recipient's healthcare provider if medical documentation is needed.
What are my responsibilities?
As an employer, you may assist employees in providing employer related information now required on Part B of the applications. We need you to closely monitor all benefits issued to your employees. When a Temporary Disability or Family Leave claim is approved, you will be issued a "Notice of Eligible Determinations" (form D20). The front of the form has important information about the employee’s benefits. Pay close attention to the dates that benefits have been approved for as you are the main validation component in this process.
If you notice benefits being issued for days that your employee may have:
worked
received vacation pay
received sick pay
we ask that you notify the Division immediately by calling our Customer Service Line (609) 292-7060 or by faxing a corrected statement (along with the employee's Social Security number) to (609) 984-4138.
What should I do if my employee asks me to complete an online employer statement?
As we all adapt to the new way of processing claims, there is sure to be some confusion during the transition period. This means that your employees out of habit may expect you to complete an employer statement for their claim. We encourage you to assist them in completing the employment information on their section to ensure all answers are accurate. At the same time, you can also let them know there is no longer a section for employers to complete.
Be sure to discard previous copies of the paper applications as our new applications are updated to reflect these changes. Utilizing the most recent version of the paper applications will satisfy meeting our programs' changes.
Do I need to complete forms when my employees apply?
In the event that we do not have enough information to approve a claim based on the reported calendar earnings or the employee's statement, you may be required to provide information. In these cases, you may receive in the mail a
request for information (form E-10)
or
request for additional wage information (form E-20).
The wage and employment information you provide is required to determine their claim, so
please complete and return this form promptly.
Failure to do so can result in a denial of benefits and a monetary penalty.
Am I reporting my employees' earnings correctly?
Be sure to keep in mind- There are 13 total weeks in a calendar quarter, but we want to know how many
base weeks
your employee earned during that period. This means you should only report the number of times they earned at least $260 per week in 2023, and $283 per week in 2024, out of the 13 calendar weeks. The difference in the number of base weeks reported could affect the approval of your employees' claim.
Also remember that the employee's
gross earnings
should be reported vs. their net amount.
Can I help my employees complete their application?
Yes, in fact it is encouraged. Your employee may be confused about some of the employment information that we used to get from you. Your assistance will ensure claimants provide accurate information on both the claimant and employment related questions.
It may be a good idea to retain a copy of the claim filings (the employment section-Part B) for your records.
What is the best way to monitor Temporary Disability benefits issued to my employees
Review the "Notice of Disability Benefits Charged or Credited" (form DS-7C) for accuracy. You will receive this notice each time State Disability Insurance benefit payments are made to your employee(s). The notice is mailed to the you on the same day that the employee’s payment posts.
The notice lists the following:
Employee’s name
Social Security number
Date the disability claim began
Period-ending date that the payment represents
Amount charged to the employer’s disability experience rating account
Taxable amount of Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)
Taxable amount of federal income tax (FIT)
Employee’s FICA tax
Employee’s Medicare tax
Federal tax withheld
Net amount paid to the worker
It may be a good idea to keep a separate file on each employee receiving Temporary Disability Insurance benefits, and adding the DS-7C received from each benefit payment to it. This way you can keep track of the charges per employee for the life of the claim. If you receive a DS-7C with multiple employees listed, make a copy for each employee listed and add it to their separate files.
Is there a way to check my employees' benefits online?
Currently, we do not have a way for you to view your employees' benefits online. Claim approval notices are received by mail.
If your employees agree to do so, you can ask them to share their benefit information with you by using the online "Check your claim status" tool and printing the "Payment Detail" page. We suggest that you keep a copy of the payment detail page for your records, and compare the days paid with dates they worked or received wages or paid time off from you.
How do I report incorrect information on an employee's claim?
If you notice benefits being issued for days that your employee may have:
worked
received vacation pay
received sick pay
we ask that you notify the Division immediately by calling our Customer Service Line (609) 292-7060 or by faxing a corrected statement (along with the employee's Social Security number) to (609) 984-4138.
What is the best way to monitor Family Leave benefits issued to my employees?
When your employee's Family Leave claim is approved, you will be issued a "Notice of Eligible Determinations" (form D20). The front of the form has the first date your employee claimed family leave benefits in Box #8. In Box #20, you can view the last day that benefits have been paid through. Pay attention to the date range between those two boxes and let us know if the claimant worked or received wages during that time frame.
For any discrepancies, we ask that you notify the Division immediately by calling our Customer Service Line (609) 292-7060 or by faxing a corrected statement (along with the employee's Social Security number) to (609) 984-4138.
Is there a way to check my employees' benefits online?
Currently, we do not have a way for you to view your employees' benefits online. All notices of eligibility are received by mail.
If your employees agree to do so, you can ask them to share their benefit information with you by having them go online using the "Check your claim status" tool and printing the "Payment Detail" page. We suggest that you keep a copy of the payment detail page for your records, and compare the days paid with dates they worked or received wages/paid time off from you.
How do I report incorrect information on an employee's claim?
If you notice benefits being issued for days that your employee may have:
worked
received vacation pay

we ask that you notify the Division immediately by calling our Customer Service Line (609) 292-7060 or by faxing a corrected statement (along with the employee's Social Security number) to (609) 984-4138.
Do my employees still need to provide me with notice of their leave?
Yes. Your employees taking family leave
bonding
in one continuous period must provide you with 30 days' notice, and 15 days' notice if taking bonding leave in a non-continuous manner.
If your employees plan to
care for a family member
and take their leave all at once, they must give you reasonable notice, unless there are unforeseen or emergency circumstances. For family caregiving taken in separate periods of leave, they must provide you with 15 days' notice before each period.
