FAQ: Maternity Leave Coverage
Get answers to questions about Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance programs for expectant and new mothers. For an overview on both wage replacement programs and how they work with job protection laws, click
here
(also
available in Spanish
).
(NEW) Are Temporary Disability benefits available for surrogates?
Yes, an eligible birthing parent may be able to receive Temporary Disability benefits for pregnancy and childbirth recovery. They must meet the minimum earnings requirement in
New Jersey covered employment
. Wages earned for being a surrogate may not be considered covered employment. Click
here
to learn more about Temporary Disability benefits during pregnancy and childbirth recovery.
(NEW) Are Family Leave Insurance benefits available for surrogacy arrangements?
Yes, an eligible nonbirthing parent(s) may be able to receive Family Leave Insurance benefits to bond with a new child within the first year of birth. Learn more
here
.
Nonbirthing parent(s) may also be eligible to receive Family Leave insurance benefits to care for a surrogate during pregnancy and childbirth recovery if they are considered family. Learn more
here
.
(NEW) Can my employer require me to use paid time off (PTO) before receiving Temporary Disability benefits?
Employers may be able to require employees to take paid time off (PTO) before Temporary Disability benefits. It depends on how they meet the requirements of the NJ Earned Sick Leave law. This law requires employers of all sizes to provide full-time, part-time, and temporary employees with up to 40 hours of paid sick time per year so they can care for themselves or a loved one.
Employers who separate NJ Earned Sick Leave from their PTO policy can require employees to take PTO before claiming Temporary Disability Insurance benefits. Employers cannot require them to take time accrued under the NJ Earned Sick Leave law.
Some employers use their PTO policy to follow the NJ Earned Sick Leave law. In this case, the employer may not require an employee to utilize any of their PTO prior to Temporary Disability benefits.
Check with your employer or HR professional to find out how they follow the NJ Earned Sick Leave law. If you believe your employer violates the Earned Sick Leave law, you may
file a complaint
with the Wage and Hour Division at NJDOL. You may still file for Temporary Disability benefits.
This is explained in more detail on our employer information page
here
.
Can I collect Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for my pregnancy?
Eligibility for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits due to pregnancy is determined in the same way as any other disability. You must meet the wage requirements, and your medical provider must certify that you are disabled and unable to work due to your pregnancy.
When should I apply for Temporary Disability Insurance if I’m pregnant?
File your application when you have stopped working and your medical provider certifies that you are unable to work due to your pregnancy.
How long can I collect Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for my pregnancy?
Benefits are usually payable up to four weeks before the expected date of delivery, and up to six weeks after you give birth (or up to eight weeks for a Caesarean delivery). If your medical provider certifies that complications exist more than four weeks before your expected delivery date or longer than eight weeks after the birth, benefits may be payable for a longer period.
Do I have to live in New Jersey to receive Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for pregnancy?
You may be eligible to receive benefits if you work in New Jersey, regardless of where you live.
Why haven't I gotten my FL2 (New Mother Bonding Notice) yet?
We send you the FL2
after
you or your healthcare provider tell us that you gave birth, whether it was a C-section or vaginal delivery, and confirm your delivery date. To notify us of your delivery information, complete the Request to Claimant for Continued Claim Information (
Form P30
). If you have not received the P30 in the mail yet, you can have your doctor complete Part C of the Temporary Disability Insurance application
(Form DS-1)
. If you received state plan Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for your pregnancy, wait for us to mail you the New Mother Bonding Notice (FL2) to apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits. Don’t try to speed things up by sending in an application for Family Leave Insurance (FL-1) before you get the FL2. Doing so will significantly delay the payment of your Family Leave Insurance benefits.
Can I collect Temporary Disability Insurance benefits if my medical provider determines that my work environment is potentially harmful to my baby?
If you are physically able to do your job, but you are exposed to environmental risks at the worksite (for example, X-rays, radiation, or chemicals), Temporary Disability Insurance benefits are
not
payable because you are not disabled. In this situation, you may qualify for
Unemployment Insurance benefits
.
Can I collect Temporary Disability Insurance benefits if my baby is sick?
To receive Temporary Disability Insurance benefits,
you
must be disabled. However, you may be able to apply for
Family Leave Insurance benefits
.
Is my employer required to hold my job for me if I get Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for my pregnancy and recovery, or Family Leave Insurance benefits to bond with my baby?
New Jersey Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance are partial wage-replacement programs. They do
not
guarantee employer-approved time off or job protection.
However, you may have job protection rights under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and/or the  New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA), which require covered employers to provide employees with unpaid, job-protected leave for up to 12 weeks. You must apply for FMLA protection directly with your employer and give 30 days' notice if your need for leave is foreseeable. For NJFLA, you must generally give 30 days' notice if your need for leave is foreseeable. Learn more about job protection
here
.
You may be eligible for Temporary Disability and Family Leave Insurance benefits whether or not your job is protected under FMLA or NJFLA. Learn how paid leave and job protection work together
here.
How long will I get paid if I applied for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits before I've given birth?
Typically, if your delivery date isn’t verified, we will pay you up to four weeks
before
and four weeks
after
your estimated due date. We know that estimated due dates aren't set in stone, so this period is designed to cover you until we receive confirmation of your delivery date.
I’m a flight attendant. When can I apply for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for my pregnancy?
Each airline has their own policy but 12 to 13 weeks before your estimated due date seems to be an average time span. You should speak to your Human Resources Representative before applying for benefits.
I’m pregnant with multiples. When can I apply for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits for my pregnancy?
The general guideline is four weeks before the estimated due date
per baby
for a multiple pregnancy. For example, a woman carrying twins would be eligible for benefits eight weeks before her estimated due date; this would increase to 12 weeks for triplets, and so on.
However, mothers of multiples are not automatically eligible for extended Temporary Disability Insurance benefits
after
delivery, during the postpartum recovery period. This period of temporary disability can be only extended if the mother suffers a qualifying complication after the birth, documented by her medical provider.
What happens if my doctor puts me on bedrest?
If you have a pregnancy complication which affects
your
health in some way, including requiring bedrest, your medical provider must explain it when filling out their part of your Temporary Disability Insurance application. He or she cannot simply list “bedrest” as the reason, or name a complication or problem experienced only by the baby.
What if my pregnancy is so complicated that I exhaust all my Temporary Disability Insurance benefits before I even deliver? Can I receive other benefits after I give birth?
When we approve a Temporary Disability claim, we list your
maximum benefit amount
on the approval notice we send. You can also get
this information online
. Keep this dollar amount in mind if you experience complications that leave you unable to work starting very early in your pregnancy. If the complications persist, you may exhaust your Temporary Disability Insurance benefits before giving birth.
The good news: A mother who exhausts her maximum Temporary Disability Insurance benefit amount before giving birth still may be eligible for up to 12 weeks of
Family Leave Insurance benefits
after delivery.
I have had an abortion, miscarriage, still birth, or lost my child. I am not able to work. Am I eligible for benefits?
Your medical provider may certify that you need time off work to physically recover from an abortion, miscarriage, or birth. You may be eligible for Temporary Disability benefits during your medical leave.
While bereavement is not specifically covered, your medical provider may certify that your mental health prevents you from working at this time. You may be eligible for
Temporary Disability
benefits during your medical leave. If your loved one needs to care for you, they may be eligible for
Family Leave
benefits.
You may also be eligible for job-protection under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act for a serious physical or mental health condition associated with an abortion, miscarriage, still birth, or loss of child. Learn more at
dol.gov
.
Can I apply for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits more than once during a year? For instance, if I receive benefits after giving birth in January, and then become temporarily disabled for another reason in September?
There is no limit to the number of times you may apply for and receive benefits, but you must meet the eligibility requirements and have medical documentation for each new claim.
I was collecting Unemployment Insurance benefits, and then became disabled due to pregnancy. What do I do now?
If you become disabled while collecting Unemployment Insurance benefits, notify the
Division of Unemployment Insurance
immediately. The division can suspend your Unemployment Insurance claim while you are unable to work. Then you can
apply for Temporary Disability Insurance benefits
. Our Disability During Unemployment section will likely process your application if you haven't had recent employment.
I recently moved, or the address you have on record is wrong. How can I change it?
You can change your address online by
clicking here
, or you can let us know in writing by mail or fax. Be sure to include your full name, your old address, your new address, your Social Security number, and sign and date the letter.
