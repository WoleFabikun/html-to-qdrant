About the Program
Family Leave Insurance provides New Jersey workers cash
benefits
to bond with a newborn, newly adopted, newly placed foster child, or to provide care for a seriously ill or injured
loved one
. While most New Jersey workers who take family leave are covered under the State’s family leave program, some employers provide Family Leave Insurance through a plan with a private insurance carrier instead. If you are not sure about your coverage, ask your employer.
How to Apply for Benefits
You can apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits
online
,
in the mail, or by fax
. Instructions for filing your claim are included in the application. Read all the instructions carefully before completing the application. If filing by mail or fax, don’t forget to sign and date the form.
If planning ahead, you may start your online application up to 60 days in advance. To avoid deletion of your draft application: (1) within 14 days of starting the
application
, provide all information and confirm your claim; then (2) within 14 days after the start of your
leave
, certify and file your claim. If applying after your leave begins, you have 30 days from your first day of leave to file your application.
How to Receive Benefits Quickly
We would like to process your claim quickly, but can’t do it without your help.
Keep these tips in mind to avoid delays and receive your benefits faster:
Apply online.
It’s faster than printing and mailing or faxing your application to us. If you are filing for family caregiving, it also allows your family member's medical provider to easily complete their section online once they get the required instructions from you.
Remember,
it is your responsibility to give these instructions to the medical provider to complete – they are
not
automatically notified by our system. If you do apply online, don’t
also
submit that claim by mail or fax. That may delay the processing of you’re application.
Fill out your application completely and accurately
. Read all instructions first. If you’re not sure how to answer a question, check out our
FAQ
or
Form Look Up
for more information. If you still need help,
contact us
.
Include your Social Security number
on all correspondence.
Don’t fax us pictures of documents.
If you want to submit a digital copy of a document, use a free mobile app like
Adobe Scan
or
Dropbox
to transform a mobile phone picture into a high-contrast, black-and-white PDF file you can print and fax.
Get ready to receive your payments.
Money Network/My Banking Direct will mail your prepaid debit card in a plain envelope (which might even look like junk mail), so check
all
your mail carefully. If you already have a debit card from a previous Temporary Disability, Family Leave, or Unemployment Insurance claim, we will use that same card to pay benefits for new claims. If you can’t find your card,
contact Money Network/My Banking Direct
for a replacement.
Who Qualifies for State Benefits
New Jersey workers are encouraged to apply.
In order to have a valid claim for Family Leave Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements. Family Leave Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.
Exemptions include:
federal government employees
out-of-state employees
faith-based organizations
workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).
If your employer is covered for Family Leave Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.  If you became unemployed recently and have a need for Family Leave Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to our
Family Leave During Unemployment
section.
How Much I Need to Earn to Qualify
Your employer is required to report your wages to the state after each calendar quarter. When your claim is under review, we consider the earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week your leave began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is called the
base year
.
To qualify for Family Leave Insurance in 2023, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $260 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $13,000 in those four quarters (the base year).
To qualify for Family Leave Insurance in 2024, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $283 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $14,200 in those four quarters (the base year).
Your regular base year period consists of 52 weeks and is determined by the date you apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits, as outlined in the chart below:
If your claim is dated in:
Your claim is based on
earnings from:
January 2024
February 2024
March 2024
October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023
April 2024
May 2024

July 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024
The wages earned during your base year will determine the amount of weekly benefits you may receive, and the total amount you can claim in a given year.
For workers who don't qualify with a standard base year, we have other ways of calculating a base year.
Click here
for more information on these alternate base years.
How Benefits Are Calculated
1. First, we calculate your average weekly wage
. We do this by dividing your base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "
base week
" is any week you earn $260 or more.
In 2024, a "
base week
" is any week you earn $283 or more.
2. Now, we can determine your weekly benefit rate.
Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage, up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.
In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.
In 2024, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,055 per week.
For example, let’s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 1, 2024. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:
Previous Completed Quarters
Timeframe Covered
Total Earnings
Number of Base Weeks
Quarter 5
10/1/23 - 12/31/23
$5,500
13 base weeks
Quarter 4
7/1/23 - 9/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 3
4/1/23 - 6/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 2
1/1/23 - 3/31/23
$4,000
10 base weeks
Quarter 1
10/1/22 - 12/31/22
$4,200
11 base weeks
Quarters 1 through 4 are the regular base year and the timeframe used to calculate his benefits.
Total base year earnings:
$18,200 which we divide by 45 (the number of base weeks)
This gives us an
average weekly wage
of $404.
Steve’s weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:
$343
If Steve is taking his leave on a day by day basis, he will receive 1/7 of his weekly benefit rate for each day he claims.
Continuous or Non-Continuous Leave
Family Leave Insurance benefits do not need to be claimed all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance benefits in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.
Continuous Leave: You may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period, if the benefits are claimed for one continuous period of unpaid leave.
Non-Continuous (intermittent) Leave: If you are claiming benefits on an intermittent schedule, whether it be a week, a month, or a day at a time, you may receive up to 56 individual days (8 weeks) of Family Leave benefits in a 12-month period. If you take your leave in a non-continuous manner, let us know those dates
after
taking each segment. If you are approved for Family Leave Insurance benefits but do not initially claim your maximum duration of leave when filing, we will mail you a
Continued Claim Certification (FL3)
, which includes a schedule that you must fill out and sign – showing the days you
did not work
during the period. You will need to submit an updated schedule after each period of leave is completed.
Keeping Your Employer Informed
You must
give your employer 30 days’ notice
if taking your family leave bonding in one continuous period, and 15 days' notice if taking your leave in a non-continuous manner. If you plan to care for a family member and take your leave all at once, you must
give your employer reasonable notice
, unless there are unforeseen or emergency circumstances and 15 days' notice for separate periods of leave.
If you do not give your employer adequate notice, your benefit entitlement may be reduced by 14 days. We encourage you to
keep your employer informed
. Having an open discussion with your employer about your need for leave will allow them to prepare for your absence and make adjustments to work schedules if necessary. Your employer may also be able to provide insight on job protection and if you qualify for it through the federal
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
or the
New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA).
How You'll Get Your Money
Applications are processed in the order they are received. Payment of benefits will be delayed if your application is incomplete or contains missing or conflicting information.
Benefits are issued on a
debit card
sent to you directly by Money Network/My Banking Direct. You will receive this card in the mail in a plain, unmarked envelope once your claim is approved.
Don’t lose it!
For Continuous Leave:
Payments are usually issued every two weeks after the initial payment, with a one-week lag for processing time. Payment may be more or less than a one-week period.
For Non-Continuous Leave:
Each day of benefits paid to you is one-seventh (1/7) of your weekly benefit rate.
Once a payment is posted, funds should be available on your debit card within three business days of the payment date. No federal income tax is withheld from your benefits unless you request a 10 percent deduction when you apply.
Family Leave benefits are paid until you: return to work, exhaust your maximum benefit entitlement, your child's first birthday, 12 months after adoptive or foster placement, or your family member no longer needs care.

How the Program Is Funded
The family leave program is financed 100% by worker payroll deductions. Employers do not contribute to the program.
For 2023, workers contribute 0.06% on the first $156,800 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2023 is $94.08. This contribution is in the form of a salary deduction that your employer takes from your weekly wages.
For 2024, workers contribute 0.09% on the first $161,400 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2024 is $145.26. This contribution is in the form of a salary deduction that your employer takes from your weekly wages.
Understanding Maximum Benefit Amounts
Workers can receive benefits for twelve consecutive weeks (84 days) or up to eight weeks (56 days) of intermittent leave in a 12-month period.
For caregiving claims, the 12-month period begins on the first day of your leave, and for bonding it begins on the child's birth, placement or adoption.
If you have not claimed your maximum benefit amount, you may reestablish a claim within the same 12-month period to care for a different family member, or during or following employment with a different employer.
After the 12-month period, regardless of whether or not you used the maximum amount of benefits, you must submit a completely new application for Family Leave Insurance benefits.

What Happens at Tax time?
After the end of each calendar year, Form 1099-G will be available in our online system for you to
download
and use when filing your federal income tax return. This form lists the total New Jersey State Family Leave Insurance (including Family Leave During Unemployment) benefits received that calendar year. This information is also sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If you receive Family Leave Insurance benefits from an approved
private plan
, your employer will provide you with the information required to file your federal income tax return.
Family Leave Insurance benefits are not taxed by the State of New Jersey.
What Benefits Are Available to Parents of Newborns?
Parents of newborns who work in New Jersey may qualify for cash benefits for time off from work to
bond
with a baby during the infant’s first year. Either the applicant or their spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner must be the biological parent of the child.
Do New Parents Need to Take Their Benefits All at Once?
New parents do not need to claim their benefits all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance to bond in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.
Continuous Leave: You may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits before your child’s first birthday, if the benefits are claimed for one continuous period of unpaid leave.
Non-Continuous (intermittent) Leave: If you are claiming benefits on an intermittent schedule, whether it be a week, a month, or a day at a time, you may receive up to 56 individual days (8 weeks) of Family Leave benefits before your child’s first birthday. If you take your leave in a non-continuous manner, let us know those dates
after
taking each segment. If you are approved for Family Leave Insurance benefits but do not initially claim your maximum duration of leave when filing, we will mail you a
Continued Claim Certification (FL3)
, which includes a schedule that you must fill out and sign – showing the days you
did not work
during the period. You will need to submit an updated schedule after each period of leave is completed.

. We do this by dividing your base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "

For 2023, workers contribute 0.06% on the first $156,800 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2023 is $94.08. This contribution is in the form of a salary deduction that your employer takes from your weekly wages.
For 2024, workers contribute 0.09% on the first $161,400 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2024 is $145.26. This contribution is in the form of a salary deduction that your employer takes from your weekly wages.
Understanding Maximum Benefit Amounts
Workers can receive benefits for twelve consecutive weeks (84 days) or up to eight weeks (56 days) of intermittent leave in a 12-month period.
The 12-month period begins on the date of your child's birth. If you have not claimed your maximum benefit amount, you may reestablish a claim within the same 12-month period to care for a family member, or during or following employment with a different employer.

What Happens at Tax Time?
After the end of each calendar year, Form 1099-G will be available online for you to
download
and use when filing your federal income tax return. This form lists the total New Jersey State Family Leave Insurance (including Family Leave During Unemployment) benefits received that calendar year. This information is also sent to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). If you receive Family Leave Insurance benefits from an approved private plan, your employer will provide you with the information required to file your federal income tax return.
Family Leave Insurance benefits are not taxed by the State of New Jersey.
Filing for Bonding Leave Benefits After Recovering from Birth
If you received Temporary Disability Insurance benefits from the state while you recovered from delivery, you will receive a
form in the mail (FL2)
with instructions on how to
apply online for Family Leave Insurance benefits
to bond with your newborn. The bonding period can begin after your doctor certifies that you have medically recovered from the birth.
If you
haven’t
received Temporary Disability Insurance benefits from the state, you can apply for Family Leave Insurance with a
paper application (FL-1)
or
online
during your baby’s first year.
About the Program
Family Leave Insurance provides New Jersey workers cash
benefits
for time off from work to bond with a newborn. While most New Jersey workers who take family leave are covered under the State’s family leave program, some employers provide Family Leave Insurance through a plan with a private insurance carrier instead. If you are not sure about your coverage, ask your employer.
Who Qualifies for State Benefits
New Jersey workers are encouraged to apply.
In order to have a valid claim for Family Leave Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements. Family Leave Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.
Exemptions include:
federal government employees
out-of-state employees
faith-based organizations
workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).
If your employer is covered for Family Leave Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.  If you became unemployed recently and have a need for Family Leave Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to our
Family Leave During Unemployment
section.
How Much I Need to Earn to Qualify
Mothers who collected state Temporary Disability Insurance for their pregnancy and immediately transition into Family Leave bonding, have already met the minimum earnings requirement. See our
maternity leave page
for more information.
All other claims
Your employer is required to report your wages to the state after each calendar quarter. When your claim is under review, we consider the earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week your leave began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is called the
base year
.
To qualify for Family Leave Insurance in 2023, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $260 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $13,000 in those four quarters (the base year).
To qualify for Family Leave Insurance in 2024, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $283 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $14,200 in those four quarters (the base year).
Your regular base year period consists of 52 weeks and is determined by the date you apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits, as outlined in the chart below:
If your claim is dated in:
Your claim is based on
earnings from:
January 2024

March 2024
October 1, 2022 to September 30, 2023

The wages earned during your base year will determine the amount of weekly benefits you may receive, and the total amount you can claim in a given year.
For workers who don't qualify with a standard base year, we have other ways of calculating a base year.
Click here
for more information on these alternate base years.
How Benefits Are Calculated
1. First, we calculate your average weekly wage
. We do this by dividing your base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "
base week
" was any week you earned $260 or more.
In 2024, a "
base week
" is any week you earn $283 or more.
2. Now, we can determine your weekly benefit rate.
Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage, up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.
In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.
In 2024, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,055 per week.
For example, let’s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 1, 2024. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:
Previous Completed Quarters
Timeframe Covered
Total Earnings
Number of Base Weeks
Quarter 5
10/1/23 - 12/31/23
$5,500
13 base weeks
Quarter 4
7/1/23 - 9/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 3
4/1/23 - 6/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 2
1/1/23 - 3/31/23
$4,000
10 base weeks
Quarter 1
10/1/22 - 12/31/22
$4,200
11 base weeks
Quarters 1 through 4 are the regular base year and the timeframe used to calculate his benefits.
Total base year earnings:
$18,200 which we divide by 45 (the number of base weeks)
This gives us an
average weekly wage
of $404.
Steve’s weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:
$343
If Steve is taking his leave on a day by day basis, he will receive 1/7 of his weekly benefit rate for each day he claims.
How You'll Get Your Money
Applications are processed in the order they are received. Payment of benefits will be delayed if your application is incomplete or contains missing or conflicting information.
Benefits are issued on a
debit card
sent to you directly by Money Network/My Banking Direct. You will receive this card in the mail in a plain, unmarked envelope once your claim is approved.
Don’t lose it!
For Continuous Leave:
Payments are usually issued every two weeks after the initial payment, with a one-week lag for processing time. Payment may be more or less than a one-week period.
For Non-Continuous Leave:
Each day of benefits paid to you is one-seventh (1/7) of your weekly benefit rate.
Once a payment is posted, funds should be available on your debit card within three business days of the payment date. No federal income tax is withheld from your benefits unless you request a 10 percent deduction when you apply.
Family Leave benefits are paid until: you return to work, exhaust your maximum benefit entitlement, or your child's first birthday.
Continuous or Non-Continuous Leave
New moms do not need to take their leave all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance to bond in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.
Continuous Leave: You may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits before your child’s first birthday, if the benefits are claimed for one continuous period of unpaid leave.
Non-Continuous (intermittent) Leave: If you are claiming benefits on an intermittent schedule, whether it be a week, a month, or a day at a time, you may receive up to 56 individual days (8 weeks) of Family Leave benefits before your child’s first birthday. If you take your leave in a non-continuous manner, let us know those dates
after
taking each segment. If you are approved for Family Leave Insurance benefits but do not initially claim your maximum duration of leave when filing, we will mail you a
Continued Claim Certification (FL3)
, which includes a schedule that you must fill out and sign – showing the days you
did not work
during the period. You will need to submit an updated schedule after each period of leave is completed.
Keeping Your Employer Informed
To receive Family Leave benefits in one continuous period, you must notify your employer 30 days’ in advance of the date you plan to start your leave. To claim your benefits in non-consecutive days, you must notify your employer 15 days’ in advance of each anticipated absence.
If you do not give your employer adequate notice, your benefit entitlement may be reduced by 14 days. We encourage you to
keep your employer informed
. Having an open discussion with your employer about your need for leave will allow them to prepare for your absence and make adjustments to work schedules if necessary. Your employer may also be able to provide insight on job protection and if you qualify for it through the federal
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
or the
New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA).

The family leave program is financed 100% by worker payroll deductions. Employers do not contribute to the program.

bond
with an adopted child or foster child during the first 12 months after the child’s adoption or placement.
Do Adoptive Parents Need to Take Their Leave All at Once?
Adoptive and Foster parents do not need to take their leave all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance to bond in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.
Continuous Leave: You may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits within a year of the child's adoption or placement, if the benefits are claimed for one continuous period of unpaid leave.
Non-Continuous (intermittent) Leave: If you are claiming benefits on an intermittent schedule, whether it be a week before returning to work or a day at a time, you may receive up to 56 individual days (8 weeks) of Family Leave benefits within a year of the child's adoption or placement. If you take your leave in a non-continuous manner, let us know those dates
after
taking each segment. If you are approved for Family Leave Insurance benefits but do not initially claim your maximum duration of leave when filing, we will mail you a

For workers who don't qualify with a standard base year, we have other ways of calculating a base year.
Click here
for more information on these alternate base years.
How Benefits Are Calculated
1. First, we calculate your average weekly wage
. We do this by dividing your base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "
base week
" was any week you earned $260 or more.
In 2024, a "
base week
" is any week you earn $283 or more.
2. Now, we can determine your weekly benefit rate.
Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage, up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.
In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.
In 2024, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,055 per week.
For example, let’s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 1, 2024. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:
Previous Completed Quarters
Timeframe Covered
Total Earnings
Number of Base Weeks
Quarter 5
10/1/23 - 12/31/23
$5,500
13 base weeks
Quarter 4
7/1/23 - 9/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 3
4/1/23 - 6/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 2
1/1/23 - 3/31/23
$4,000
10 base weeks
Quarter 1
10/1/22 - 12/31/22
$4,200
11 base weeks
Quarters 1 through 4 are the regular base year and the timeframe used to calculate his benefits.
Total base year earnings:
$18,200 which we divide by 45 (the number of base weeks)
This gives us an
average weekly wage
of $404.
Steve’s weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:
$343
If Steve is taking his leave on a day by day basis, he will receive 1/7 of his weekly benefit rate for each day he claims.
How You'll Get Your Money
Applications are processed in the order they are received. Payment of benefits will be delayed if your application is incomplete or contains missing or conflicting information.
Benefits are issued on a

For Continuous Leave:
Payments are usually issued every two weeks after the initial payment, with a one-week lag for processing time. Payment may be more or less than a one-week period.

give your employer 30 days’ notice
before starting your leave. If you are bonding in separate periods of leave, you must give your employer 15 days' notice before each period of leave.
If you do not give your employer adequate notice, your benefit entitlement may be reduced by 14 days. We encourage you to
keep your employer informed
. Having an open discussion with your employer about your need for leave will allow them to prepare for your absence and make adjustments to work schedules, if necessary. Your employer may also be able to provide insight on job protection and if you qualify for it through the federal

In order to have a valid claim for Family Leave Insurance, you need to have paid into the program through your employment and meet minimum gross earnings requirements. Family Leave Insurance is available to most New Jersey workers.
Exemptions include:
federal government employees
out-of-state employees
faith-based organizations
workers that are not technically employees (such as contractors).
If your employer is covered for Family Leave Insurance, they are required to set up payroll contributions for you. If you believe you are covered under the program but payroll contributions have not been made, you are still encouraged to apply as it may have been an error.  If you became unemployed recently and have a need for Family Leave Insurance, you still may be eligible for benefits and we encourage you to apply. In that case, we will forward your application to our
Family Leave During Unemployment
section.
How Much I Need to Earn to Qualify
Your employer is required to report your wages to the state after each calendar quarter. When your claim is under review, we consider the earnings reported for the 5 completed quarters prior to the week your leave began. The first 4 quarters of that time frame is called the
base year
.
To qualify for Family Leave Insurance in 2023, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $260 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $13,000 in those four quarters (the base year).
To qualify for Family Leave Insurance in 2024, you must have worked 20 weeks earning at least $283 weekly, or have earned a combined total of $14,200 in those four quarters (the base year).
Your regular base year period consists of 52 weeks and is determined by the date you apply for Family Leave Insurance benefits, as outlined in the chart below:

The wages earned during your base year will determine the amount of weekly benefits you may receive, and the total amount you can claim in a given year.
For workers who don't qualify with a standard base year, we have other ways of calculating a base year.

for more information on these alternate base years.
How Benefits Are Calculated
1. First, we calculate your average weekly wage
. We do this by dividing your base year earnings by the number of base weeks.
In 2023, a "
base week
" was any week you earned $260 or more.
In 2024, a "
base week
" is any week you earn $283 or more.
2. Now, we can determine your weekly benefit rate.
Claimants are paid 85% of their average weekly wage, up to the maximum weekly benefit rate set for that calendar year.
In 2023, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,025 per week.
In 2024, the maximum weekly benefit rate is $1,055 per week.
For example, let’s say Steve's first day of family leave is Friday, March 1, 2024. To see how much he would receive weekly on Family Leave Insurance, we look at his reported wages for the first four of the last five completed quarters:
Previous Completed Quarters
Timeframe Covered
Total Earnings
Number of Base Weeks
Quarter 5
10/1/23 - 12/31/23
$5,500
13 base weeks
Quarter 4
7/1/23 - 9/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 3
4/1/23 - 6/30/23
$5,000
12 base weeks
Quarter 2
1/1/23 - 3/31/23
$4,000
10 base weeks
Quarter 1
10/1/22 - 12/31/22
$4,200
11 base weeks
Quarters 1 through 4 are the regular base year and the timeframe used to calculate his benefits.
Total base year earnings:
$18,200 which we divide by 45 (the number of base weeks)
This gives us an
average weekly wage
of $404.
Steve’s weekly benefit rate is 85% of his average weekly wage:
$343
If Steve is taking his leave on a day by day basis, he will receive 1/7 of his weekly benefit rate for each day he claims.
How You'll Get Your Money
Applications are processed in the order they are received. Payment of benefits will be delayed if your application is incomplete or contains missing or conflicting information.
Benefits are issued on a
debit card
sent to you directly by Money Network/My Banking Direct. You will receive this card in the mail in a plain, unmarked envelope once your claim is approved.
Don’t lose it!
For Continuous Leave:
Payments are usually issued every two weeks after the initial payment, with a one-week lag for processing time. Payment may be more or less than a one-week period.
For Non-Continuous Leave:
Each day of benefits paid to you is one-seventh (1/7) of your weekly benefit rate.
Once a payment is posted, funds should be available on your debit card within three business days of the payment date. No federal income tax is withheld from your benefits unless you request a 10 percent deduction when you apply.
Family Leave benefits are paid until you: return to work, exhaust your maximum benefit entitlement, or your family member no longer needs care.
Continuous or Non-Continuous Leave
Family Caregivers do not need to take their leave all at once. You can claim Family Leave Insurance to provide care in one consecutive 12-week period, or on a day-by-day basis to suit your needs. However, the manner in which you choose to claim your leave will determine the duration of leave that you are entitled to.
Continuous Leave: You may receive up to 12 weeks of benefits in a 12-month period, if the benefits are claimed for one continuous period of unpaid leave.
Non-Continuous (intermittent) Leave: If you are claiming benefits on an intermittent schedule, whether it be a week, a month, or a day at a time, you may receive up to 56 individual days (8 weeks) of Family Leave benefits in a 12-month period. If you take your leave in a non-continuous manner, let us know those dates
after
taking each segment. If you are approved for Family Leave Insurance benefits but do not initially claim your maximum duration of leave when filing, we will mail you a
Continued Claim Certification (FL3)
, which includes a schedule that you must fill out and sign – showing the days you
did not work
during the period. You will need to submit an updated schedule after each period of leave is completed.
Keeping Your Employer Informed
If you plan to care for a family member and take your leave all in one continuous period, you must
give your employer reasonable notice
, unless there are unforeseen or emergency circumstances. If you plan to take intermittent days off to care for a family member, you must give your employer at least 15 days’ notice, unless there are unforeseen or emergency circumstances.
If you do not give your employer adequate notice, your benefit entitlement may be reduced by 14 days. We encourage you to
keep your employer informed
. Having an open discussion with your employer about your need for caregiving leave will allow them to prepare for your absence and make adjustments to work schedules, if necessary. Your employer may also be able to provide insight on job protection and if you qualify for it through the federal
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
or the
New Jersey Family Leave Act (NJFLA).

How the Program Is Funded
The family leave program is financed 100% by worker payroll deductions. Employers do not contribute to the program.
For 2023, workers contribute 0.06% on the first $156,800 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2023 is $94.08. This contribution is in the form of a salary deduction that your employer takes from your weekly wages.
For 2024, workers contribute 0.09% on the first $161,400 (
wage cap
) in covered wages earned during this calendar year. The maximum worker contribution for 2024 is $145.26. This contribution is in the form of a salary deduction that your employer takes from your weekly wages.
Understanding Maximum Benefit Amounts
Workers can receive benefits for up to twelve consecutive weeks (84 days) or up to eight weeks (56 days) of intermittent leave in a 12-month period.
The 12-month period begins on the first day of your leave.
If you have not claimed your maximum benefit amount, you may reestablish a claim within the same 12-month period to care for a different family member, or during or following employment with a different employer.
