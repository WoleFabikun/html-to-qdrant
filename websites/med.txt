Temporary Disability Insurance
Family Leave Insurance
Can I certify a patient's need for gender affirmation procedures?
Yes,
medical providers
can certify a patient’s need for gender affirmation procedures, including but not limited to, top surgery, bottom surgery, facial feminization or masculinization, voice surgery, tracheal shaving, etc. Medical providers can also certify the need for a patient’s loved one to help them recover. The
definition of loved one
is generous.
Can I charge a fee for completing my patient’s Temporary Disability paperwork?
No. The N.J.S.A. 12:18-1.6 prohibits charging a fee to complete Temporary Disability forms.
Is it safe and secure to file my patient’s medical information online?
Yes. Precautions are taken to keep the information that you provide in the online application private and secure. The online application uses a secure connection and the data submitted is encrypted.
If my patient has a planned/scheduled surgery date can I fill out their paperwork ahead of time?
No. A disability claim cannot be filed until the period of disability actually begins.
I gave my patient’s estimated recovery date on the original application. Why didn’t my patient receive benefits until the date I provided?
In order to certify the patient is under continuous medical care, and because the outcome of a patient’s condition can change at any moment, we require the physician to routinely certify medical information for the duration of the claim. We typically issue benefits for the onset of the disability period, and request an updated medical statement to extend the benefits further.
Do I need to have seen my patient on the first day of their disability period?
No. You do not have to physically treat the patient on the same day they became disabled. You must be treating the patient within
10 days
from the start of their disability period.
What is an approved medical practitioner under the Temporary Disability Benefits Law?

Why am I having trouble submitting my patient’s medical information online?
There are various reasons the online medical application may not allow you to proceed.
You should be aware that you may only complete your patient’s medical statement online while their claim is status pending. Once an application for benefits is either approved or denied, information can no longer be submitted online. In that case, you can submit medical information by faxing or mailing to the division a
paper application (Part C).
Another reason you may have trouble accessing the online medical application is that the claimant may have provided you the incorrect Form ID. If the Form ID you have does not work, reach out to your patient to confirm.
Currently our online medical application works best by using the Internet Explorer web browser. If you’re using a different browser, such as Firefox or Google Chrome, you may also experience difficulties.
Is the Division of Temporary Disability Insurance exempt from HIPAA regulations?
Yes. The New Jersey Temporary Disability Benefits program is not a covered entity under HIPAA. All medical records are confidential and are not open to public inspection.
In what circumstances am I required to provide complications for a patient’s pregnancy?
Benefits are usually payable up to four weeks before the expected date of delivery, and up to eight weeks after delivery. If your patient is medically unable to work outside of this time frame, the division will ask if there are complications associated with the pregnancy. It is important to know that the complications must be current to
this
pregnancy and must affect the mother, not only the fetus. Having a
history
of complications does not prove the patient is unable to work now.
Can I submit hospital records in lieu of completing the medical certificate?
No. While hospital records often provide useful information; they do not always address the specific requirements that we need to approve a claim. For example, if a patient goes to the emergency room for testing, the hospital records will show that they were there for testing and what the findings are, but may not clearly state the patient is medically unable to work and the diagnosis that prevents them from working. Therefore, completing the questions specifically asked of you on the medical certificate ensures that the information you provide is sufficient.
Can I certify a patient's need for care due to gender affirmation procedures?
Yes,
medical providers
can certify a patient’s need for gender affirmation procedures, including but not limited to, top surgery, bottom surgery, facial feminization or masculinization, voice surgery, tracheal shaving, etc. Medical providers can also certify the need for a patient’s loved one to help them recover. The
definition of loved one
is generous.
What date on the medical certificate drives the first day of Family Leave?
The start of the Family Leave claim is the first date that care is
provided
to your patient. The patient’s condition may be preexisting, but the caregiver’s claim is specific to when they stopped working to care for their family member.

Is pregnancy a valid condition that may require care from a family member?
Yes, pregnancy is a condition that may require care from a family member.
Can I charge a fee for completing my patient’s caregiver’s Family Leave Insurance paperwork?
No. The N.J.S.A. 12:18-1.6 prohibits charging a fee to complete Family Leave Insurance forms.
Is it safe and secure to file my patient’s medical information online?
Yes. Precautions are taken to keep the information that you provide in the online application private and secure. The online application uses a secure connection, and the data submitted is encrypted.
Why am I having trouble submitting my patient’s medical information online?
There are various reasons the online medical application may not allow you to proceed.
You should be aware that you may only complete your patient’s medical statement online while their caregiver’s claim is status pending. Once an application for benefits is either approved or denied, information can no longer be submitted online. In that case, you can submit medical information by faxing or mailing to the division part C of the
paper application
.
Another reason you may have trouble accessing the online medical application is that the claimant may have provided you the incorrect Form ID. When a caregiver files an online family leave application, they are provided with two unique Form IDs: one to give to their family member’s medical practitioner and one for their employer. Often, claimants provide the incorrect code to either party, or give the same code to both. If the Form ID you have does not work, reach out to your patient’s caregiver to confirm.
Currently our online medical application works best by using the Internet Explorer web browser. If you’re using a different browser, such as Firefox or Google Chrome, you may also experience difficulties.
Is the Division of Temporary Disability Insurance exempt from HIPAA regulations?
The NJ Temporary Disability Benefits Program is not a “covered entity” under the
Federal Health Information Portability and Accountability Act
(HIPAA). All medical records of the Division, except to the extent necessary for the proper administration of the Temporary Disability Benefits Law are confidential and are not open to public inspection. The Division protects all records that may reveal the identity of the claimant, or the nature or cause of the disability and the records may only be used in proceedings arising under the Law.
